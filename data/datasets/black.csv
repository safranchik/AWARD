" Means as we always offer excuses for different thing in our life but let us always remember that. Jesus said in his scarf - no cloak for you're seeing that's no excuse. Therefore my beloved this morning as I start with a category, keep in mind."
" I'm reminded of a story, which I read sometime back. And I thought, my husband told you this awful story sometimes for over 85 year old man who was sitting on a park bench, one day tears, running down his face, he was crying and then a passerby came by who noticed that the tears were running down the elder, man. Cheese, he stopped to see if he could do anything to help."
" Yes, he stopped. He said sure, I don't want to intrude on you, but is there anything I can do to relieve? Your distress? Is there anything wrong at home in the elderly man? Looked at him with tears, coming down his eyes."
" And he said no, everything is fine at home."
 I have a big beautiful house.
" I have two new calls, a swimming pool. He's, I even have a 35 year old wife, who is a superb cook. She's a great cook. And you know what? She thinks? She treats me like a king."
" And she love me, madly."

 Are you crying?
 In the elder man replied to him.
 I'm crying because I can't remember where I live bomi. My brother sister this morning. I believe that many of us don't remember where we live.
" Don't remember, whatever needs an AME Church is right there on Main Street, or ml/kg drive pass by keep passing by, because you have forgotten where you live did, I witness in the house, but this morning, Jesus says, I am the Good Shepherd. I'm not a hireling, a Holland. My brother sister is wounded and hired out to wash over the Sheep."
 It is soon. He collect his urn he leaves. So it's a big bad will come and attack that she he not concerned about But A Good Shepherd
" I'm okay, show a good shepherd."
" Stays with the Sheep through the thick and the thin, through the up-and-down, to the Bad and the good through the hard time ever touched her. She care for the she look out for the Sheep. That's what a good Shuffle do by Helen calm."
" Just a little while, get it paid and then go home, you know, witness in the house. But by all mean this morning, I want you to know what a good shepherd is, you know, witness in the house. You see, we hear this song Nusrat crowd and Psalm 119 and 176"
 And that song is that I'm wondering like a lost sheep.
" That's what many of us are doing wandering, like a lost sheep. And when we rejoice in their assurance, that Jesus our Good Shepherd will show us the way I am, the Gate of the Sheepfold. That's what the Lord is telling us. Anyone who entered through we must come in safely through Jesus."
" This morning, my brother and sister about all me, you need to reconcile with yourself and understand. Bible of that. The Lord is the Good Shepherd. And I stand with the Lord. I am the Good Shepherd and eyewitness in the house. Many of us living in the past, holding old grudges,"
" Look what they used to do. What they did, do days, has passed it to him, right. I said the day is past and gone the Evening Shade appear. Oh Hallelujah. This is the other day.

When you go on at the grocery store, you can feel your best. It up for $30. Can't do that anymore. This is the now my beloved and we must walk with the Lord right now. Not in yesteryears right now, right now today tomorrow and as God give you another, when you must walk hand and hand with the Lord, and"
 I realize that he is because Ship by all means.
" Well, I'll do it when I get myself together. You'll never get yourself together because you don't have God, you need to walk with the Lord. So you'll be able to find yourself is eyewitness in the house."
" Therefore my beloved by all me throughout this gospel, that John tell us different figures are used to describe the way in which Jesus come to offer us eternal life. One way he come. We see. Jesus is the bread of life, is that eyewitness in the house. By all means. You need to understand that there are other ways that he is the light of the world."
 If I witness in the house.
" The third way, he is the resurrection and the life join. Tell her that he is the way. And the truth, John told that Jesus is the beloved, Son of God, who guide us and protect us. He's a good ship and into this day gospel, that's when we look and see, that Jesus is the Good Shepherd in our witness in the house."
" In a Good Shepherd stick with you through it all through this pandemic, he didn't run off and leave you. When you love to job, he didn't run off and leave you health insurer. He didn't run off and leave love what he didn't run off and leave. He stood with you because he is the Good Shepherd and I love Molly myself after that, I am the Good Shepherd. I want to beat a good ship one who thick around a helped you to nurse you protect you here."
 You through do rough day is eyewitness in. How about all me? We need to turn our Hallelujah. Vision toward the lord this morning.
" Mother Love metaphorically speaking. There is a story told of a veteran Rancher, who love to teach Sunday school. And he compared sheep to Kyle because he was a Rancher used to herding cows."
" In metaphorically. Speaking we deduct observation and he noticed that cows are herding. Cows will act in particular ways, cows, was shy away from someone waving a stick at them. Cows. Also know enough, not to get too concerned, with when a stick is way that them cows. Don't Panic very easily. However, on the other hand,"
 He noticed that sheets are not smart enough to be heard.
 That's it. Like We Never Cry hit worksheet. We need someone to walk with us to guide us and teach us to help us protect us.
" Because you're not smart enough. I know you may have a PhD in a DDD, but let me tell you something, you still not smart enough."
" As my grandfather you said you have your on the too short to box with God, regardless of what degree you have. You still not smart enough and eyewitness in the house. Might I clarify something on the other hand, she says, I'm not smart enough to her. She out of their ignorance, they Panic real easily, isn't it just like us?"
" Something. How was just Panic that go, all to pieces nerves all to her, instead of taking it to the Lord in prayer? If I witness in the house, by all means that it's our nature."
" Into hellish eat, my blood below. The shepherd has to to condition them to trust. That's why I'm a Good Shepherd. You need to learn to trust the Lord trust in him who have placed me in the doorway to nurses you and guide you and show you that about a way you don't have to live in a yesterday. You can live in the right now with Christ Jesus."
" But you have to put your faith in Jesus and who he a place in your incentive to lead you, you know, witness in the house. You have to trust."
" Get you know that uh, follow him, she cannot be heard it like house but must be led, you know, witness in the house. You see, you must be late in order for you to"
" To receive. And by all means, understand what Christ is trying to hide his crime, protect you, you need to have faith in the Lord, trust the Lord, he placed individual in your life in order to help guide you and to Shield you from anything that you may get a better understanding of life and where you are with him in your relationship, you need to trust the Lord, that you'll be able to do unto others, as to you have them to do unto. You is eyewitness in the house. If you want someone to love you, try loving them back."
" You want someone to trust you, try trusting someone did eyewitness in the house."
 But owe me my beloved this morning understand that she cannot be heard like how but must be late for their safety and survival sheet. Need to rely on that relationship with the shepherd. What type of relationship do you have with God?
" I can tell you my beloved, I can feel the relationship that you have but God better relationship. You had with me. I am his trusty and you helped our relationship with medium. That tell me that you're not a God because Spirit recognize Spirit, you know, witness in the house."
 Oh yes my beloved by all means you need to do as to handle writing on the wall saving Old Testament. We need to get your house in order. You know witness in the house. It is a house that does not but below that does not
" Anyhow that's does not, it's not in order in doing that work together in harmony and peace. Can I stand there for by all me? But all may not make sense by any means necessary. But this one I'm saying about all me. My beloved"
 We need to learn to trust.
 The Lord stop living in the past.
" Because I serve a right now, God."
" Not a God or the yesteryear, but a right now God, you know, witness in the house, you see, even need to see then why Jesus identified himself with as a Good Shepherd, don't you?"
" And not a cowboy because Cowboy herd cow but a Shepherd lead sheets. You know, witness in the house. I'm not a cowboy."
" I am a Shepherd, you know, witness in the house because I am a follower of Jesus."
" You know, eyewitness in the house, I am the Good Shepherd, says the Lord, the good Chef is one who laid down his life for his sheep. Don't the Lord said in 1011 Jesus, lay down his life in order that we may have life and have it more abundantly. It is, he who hanging up on character Mountain it, he hang up on, Call on the cross."
" If I witness in the house, you see the Good Shepherd has come to lead us out of bondage."
 The good ship has. Come to liberate us from the drudgery of this just existing but offering us new life.
" He offered a new life in the spirit. Hallelujah, of Truth and I witness in the house. Therefore my beloved"
 The Lord is my shepherd.
 And I shall not want.
" The measure of a sheep and a shepherd with one of the real in the days of Jesus time. Because in that time a sheep you had to, you had to be on watch because of the sheep wandered away. He may decide to go on a low place inside to the rest, and if he turned him, they use the turning back in the day called Cash. You had to watch the other sheep wouldn't cast if she wants to cash my brother which means that you see out there laying the low place as taking this enjoying himself and mr. And lay on his side,"
" If you weight shifting to get turned over to 40, King says backup."
" And therefore The Shepherd of watching, this is a hot day by him scrubbing, trying to set itself up, he will perish and then why Shepherd should always be on watch for wool for she cast himself and often time I feel like we have went out and cast ourselves because we go out."
 We go out and forget the god of blessing the mighty way we overspend.
 we don't give
 But we always be there and they were all we want.
 Somebody to give to us but the key and give him my beloved.
 Is what Jesus said in the Golden Rule.
" Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. He that witness in the house by all means. My beloved, a Good Shepherd will spend hours searching for a single sheet when it's missing because he's scared that the cause of the animal, maybe he might have went out of cash himself and he had cast himself."
" He's getting, he will lose his life and once he find the sheep, and finally, here kashyap his self. He slowly approaches sheep, and begin to turn it back to his normal play. And he rubbed his leg to put circulation back into it."
" Any hold it in an almond speak, softly to it in the same time at Morrison and assault Force, we can recognize that I love you but you have got to take responsibility for your life."
" Don't be no naive and get yourself in a situation like this repeatedly. Repeatedly repeatedly. It's God. Get your groupie to walk back into it. But all me, my beloved"
 Rescuing a sheep in one of the most rewarding experiences in the life of a good ship. Let me if you will metaphorically speaking.
" Let me say this one of the greatest point in my life, when my daughter has set the Christ, but not only that, but she further herself into the ministry, and now she ordained ministers. I am blessed. And then one of the greatest point in my life, ever Shepherd that, tell me anything after helping my life, I've live and seen a positive thing for the ministry that I have presented for her in her own words. She said I have watched you over the years. You may thought I would listen but I wasn't listening."
" Learn, there's something greater than I am and that is to Christ maybe baby, the son of God."
" He will lay hang up on camera from the 16th to the 19th. And she's, I know, I believe and I watch you lay by. Watch you love the people. I want you to help develop thing that undeveloped oil and I watch over the years, and I seen the positive thing that coming down for. I want to do that work."
 and that let me know my beloved
" Contrary to popular opinion, I am the Good Shepherd, you know, witness in the house."
" and once again, as I set the stage again, and again, my beloved, as the shepherd such as folded flock,"
 The one that is lost just one single sheet that is missing the more often than not.
 He will seek to find it before we lose it life.
 Because he feared that he might be too late.
" But look at the Jordan, Jordan hair, when he find the sheep in, his sheep is doing well and it's seek out the rice and they want to walk with the Lord, by any means necessary."
 When when are you going to learn when he finally she asked him. What are you going to learn to stand on your feet? I'm so glad I found you in time. Aren't you glad you found the Lord in time. Aren't you glad that he found you in time?
 Don't you go to stand on your feet and stop being a little rascal.
" And so the conversation goes on like this, my beloved"
" We should always have compassion, but we need to reboot what rebuke need to be. How compassion, and we need to be able to correct people correction.

I just want to encourage you on today. So often we miss out on what God sees in us for he has a great plan and purpose for our lives. So I just want to encourage you on today through the book of Jeremiah chapter 20 and how sometimes"
" Times. We feel like giving up but let's go into a word of prayer gracious. Father, we thank you, Lord God for another Day's Journey for. This is the day, the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it. I thank you Lord God for this opportunity. Lord God to share your word, share the gospel, the good news, Lord God to the people or God that there might be. Someone is going through and feel like giving up, Lord God, that trials and tribulations and problems of this world have gotten the best of them. Lord."
" But I ask you to give them a renewal of the spirit right now. I pray for those who are sick, Lord God, who are going through and I just pray that you heal their land or God that you give them rest on every side. Lord God. So I just pray, Lord God, that this word be preached. Clearly, that it brings come formation or God that you're still out. Awesome God. Wonderful God. A faithful God, they bring Comfort to your people."
" Now, open our eyes. So we may see the wonderful things in your word that we can apply it to our lives. In Jesus name, I do pray, amen. Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 20 verse number 9, Jeremiah chapter 20 verse number 9. Then I said, I will not make mention of him nor speak."
" Any more of his name but his word was in my heart like a burning fire, like a burning fire, shut up in my bones. I was weary of holding it back and I could not. I I wanted to talk from the thought this morning fired up or burnout fired up a burnout often"
" Sometimes we find ourselves. We really have been out of the will of God, where we lose our Zeal, we lose our excitement about serving God, and sometimes we feel like giving up. Here's Jeremiah. Even at the beginning of the ministry, we find out in chapter 1 of Jeremiah that God called Jeremiah."
" To do a mighty work for he. What he said in verse number 4, Jeremiah chapter 1. He said then the word of the Lord came to me saying before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, I'm here to let you know this morning that God knows you before you even formed in your mother's womb, that God had a plan and a purpose for your life. God knows your name. And can I tell you? You're just not here by some coincidence, that that do."
" Life has meaning when it comes to God, that he has set you on a path that we must walk. So often, we feel that we're not Purpose Driven that we have no purpose in life, but if you see God, you'll find that you have purple. He said he tells Jeremiah before you was formed in your mother's womb. I knew you, I can't who you were. He says before you were born, he said."
" A i sanctify to sanctify me. I sent you a part to do a mighty work. God has set us apart to do a mighty work on this morning. And so often what we, what God have Intel for us. We often forfeit on it that most people don't know that God has a plan and a purpose for their life. He tells Jeremiah, I know you, I know you, I call you. He said this way you say,"
" Our dang, you a prophet to Nation. Can I tell you on this morning? Dad just give you a background of Jeremiah in the first chapter and we going to get back to chapter 20. But that that Jeremiah was qualified. God has gained Jeremiah assignment. He said I ordained you"
" A prophet to the nation's he says, in other words I qualified you Jeremiah I quantify a job and they said listen, whoever missing on this morning, he God is saying you a qualified to go through what you're going through that it had to happen. Whatever. Going through your life, whatever happened in your life, you was qualified forward. And I'm so happy that this morning that God is going to disqualify me to do many things and that not only"
" We often when God gives of a purpose, often says we make excuses."
" Here's Jeremiah in verse number, 6 of chapter 1, he says I Lord God behold I cannot speak for. I met you at this time. Jeremiah Was Young. He was a young man. He comes up with an excuse and God, I know you call. I know you for me. I know you knew me. I know you qualify Me by, I can't do this. I can't do this. There's this. I'm too young and so often we come up with excuses of not serving God, I'm too tired."
" Let somebody else do it. So often we say I can't speak in front of people but look what God tells, Jeremiah, everything chapter 1 of Jeremiah verse number self, but the Lord said to me do not say I am young for I for you shall go to all to whom I seen you if we just have a desk that's just just a notion to just believe."
" Even God. And ingest. Do what? He just tell us to do. Oh listen, listen, this is something we'll begin to happen and we begin to activate our faith for he says, and whatever I command you, you shall speak. And the way he tells me, he tells Jeremiah. He said, do not be afraid of their faces. That's going to be some things on this journey, where people are gonna look at you strange, where people are going to turn their nose up."
" Up on you while people are going to turn their backs on you when they're gonna look at you. Like you're crazy when you start talking about this God. But but look what God tells Jeremiah and where he's telling us this morning, do not be afraid of their faces, find with you to deliver. You says, the Lord, God is saying that he's with us this morning."
" That he's with us, no matter what it is. Jeremiah saying to the Lord, I really don't want to do this and God begins to move on him to be a prophet. He begin to prophesize and and the more he speaks, the more God shows him his gift and the more he is the enemy comes after him. Can I tell you on today, that"
" As you begin to serve God, you will have enemies coming after you, you are have some naysayers coming after you, but here's Jeremiah, he begins to trust God and he begins to move in a way that God can use them, and the more God move at the more Jeremiah move, the more God shows him his gift. But now we in chapter 20 in Jeremiah is"
" I'm sorry in chapter 19 in Jeremiah it's giving a Simon. Now, he's in the middle of his ministry and it seemed now that everything by now. Should he should have down packing? No problems by all of a sudden. He is faced with a situation for in verse number. And chapter number 19, will find that Jeremiah in verse number chapter that I'm in chapter number 19."
" We'll find that Jeremiah begin to have an assignment from God, chapter 19, verses 14 and 15. It says in Jeremiah came from to affect where the Lord has sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the Lord house and said, to all the people thus says, the Lord of hosts, the god of Israel behold. I will bring or this city and all"
" And all her tie-downs, all the Doom that I have pronounced against it because they have stiffened their necks. That's, they might not hear my words. He is Jeremiah and Jeremiah had assignment to tell the people to repent, turn back to God, but they were so rebellious. That was so bad."
" He was so passionate about the people and he began to see how these people were turned only loving God. And he will often weep and telling the people to repent and they would not, they will not change the heart. So now he's, he's declaring Doom that that these people because of that diesel beating and that God was going to have enemy that come in and take them in captivity for a 70 years. And and here"
" Here he is faced in chapter 19, just going with the says the Lord and find himself in a bad situation because in the beginning of chapter 20 we are see now par sure the song of Elmer the priest who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord. Here's Jeremiah prophesied these things."
" I'm not a priest. Now he is Jeremiah prophesied, these things of Doom and then pashur struck, Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stop. He put him in down. That were that were in the high Gates of Benjamin, which was the house of the Lord. Here's, here's Jeff might just do. What does says the Lord? He gets drunk. He get hit by"
" Hello Kris. But they began to believe that he was lying that he would came a false prophet, but here's this man a pasture. Uh-huh. Hell. I Office of the chief Priests of the house of the Lord in the temple. Now, Pastor was in position because of birth, Jeremiah was in position because of a column. Woman were born in place. Another man was born out of place Pastor. I was appointed."
" According to the virtue of birth, which means he comes into a job. Check this out, without spiritual awareness, that a lot of people coming to a job without spiritual awareness. But Pasha is place because he is appointed. Jeremiah is place because he's anointed, anointed means or anointing is a bird. A bird and removal."
" Move removing a Yelp braking power of God. In other words, anointing is what empowers a man, or a woman to function? Supernaturally can I help somebody on today? When somebody is Anointed, that means they're empowered by God, to do some miraculous things that they could not do in their own power. But here Jeremiah"
" One is appointed. And another one is Anointed and at this point, Jeremiah is a first man in a second position. He's the first man in a second position. Here's dare Maya preaching, only telling the people wet that says the law, But Here Comes This Profit just because in position, begin to shed old Jeremiah"
" But can I tell you? It has to be flush training to serve God and does do, and do, and do everything. That is right is still have trouble to come up in Jeremiah, was in a terrible situation because you have to understand that he did but thus says the Lord. But you got to understand this"
" and it just reminds me of David and King, Saul, David was anointed by God to be made King. But Saul was still the king. You have to learn to work with folks who are not anointed but how the position you got to watch who you hang out with because appointed folks, or easy target for the devil to hinder. I know it t folks."
" it is, here he is, thrown into prison, he is smacked and whip and is trying to understand"
" It. Now, he's disapprove, he's opposed by an appointed over anointed. He is Jeremiah sad in this hard one day, it hurt him so bad. Y'all that, that listen, it's told him so far, here's Jeremiah, is verse. Number 7 of chapter XX saying O Lord, you will deceive me. You induce me I was"
" Persuaded, I want to see you are stronger than I and I have proof and have Prevail. I am a mock daily. Everyone mocks me for when I smoke and cry it out and shouted, violent and plunder or destruction, Lord, that people were going against me. And I did what you told me to do, but it seems like everything is going."
 It's me.
 Here's God.
" Being God, letting us know that we can't have it. Good. All the time that that you have to understand that somebody right now this morning thought that by now, everything will be. Alright, that you everything will be moving in the direction you thought it was supposed to be because you are serving God, that that by now, that things should begin better by. Now that you believe,"
" That people should be lining up with you and following you by now. But back now it seemed like the more you serve God the more you serve God, it seemed like that. One. Troubles shows up the Greater. The afflictions seemed like the great anointing, the greater the Affliction. And can I tell you? Here's Jeremiah, he's confused, y'all, he's well, he's too important where he doesn't understand what's going on and then"
" It's often the questions that I often have that God. Let me see what you see in me first though, often, we do not see what God has for us. So often we do not see what God has doing, what it's going in our life, huh? We only see trouble on every side but here's Jeremiah. He just like you and me just human, he's like to the point where it seems like he's not making a"
" On this journey. So he began to believe that every day he preached that that that that's insult, that's mockery and that's right attitude because of what he stands for and he began to say I wouldn't I will not make mention of him. No more. He's that some people say I'm not gonna do this no more. That I'm going to throw in the towel that I'm tired of serving. I'm tired of doing, right? And"
 Nothing seemed to result everywhere. I look around at people perfect. Perfect claim to be Christians and but they live in any kind of way that they don't treat people like they're supposed to. I'm tired of trying to be the bigger person that now I'm tired of trying to deserve it. I see no results that it seems like I'm the only one serving God. It seem like I'm the only one really trying to live for you. Everybody else suggests in position.
 That has no spiritual awareness.
" Here's oh Jeremiah you say I quit? I just quit. I had enough. Have anybody ever been that way? You just feel like you quit you. Let people get on your nerves you. Let people get the best of you and you just quit on God. Have anybody ever? Quit on God because of people, and you ever looked at somebody life who profess to be a Christian and then turn around say that's why I'm going to church because of dim. But"
" I tell you all the gay, my brothers and sisters. It has nothing to do with people, but it has everything to do with your relationship between you and God. It's between you and God, not between you people that you see, Professor be somebody because they hold the position, anybody can say who they are. But can I tell you, is something about being anointed by God."
" That God empowers you to do some great but here's Jeremiah, he's burned out y'all and also often that Kristen get burned out because of what's going on around them that they missed the mall because they do not see the move of God in their life. Because everybody thinks once you become a Christian, that things will get better and better and that that gas not do I. God is trying to get you to understand that he said, no matter"
" We don't get any better. It doesn't matter if it get better from this point. Oh yes, trust me. Not lean to your own understanding but in all your ways are not as me that somebody here today, you've been struggling, you've been drifting, you've been being Carried Away by a situation slowly. You stop serving slowly. You'll stop praying slowly. You'll stop doing with the things of the Lord. Now you find yourself custom / using profanity like never before now you"
" Find yourself doing things that you used to do before you met God, now you find yourself. I don't know will of God because you have drift away from his love and he is dare Maya. Say I quit."
 How about that? And some people have quit doing this pandemic that have quit.
" It God is still blessing them. They still quit y'all. I mean God look at what Jeremiah say this. I know this anointing is real when I tried to quit the Fire won't let me when I quit. When I tried to quit, I guess could throw in the towel. Why? I know they got on my nerves. I know they got the best of me. But God, I want to quit."
" Juice something inside of me, telling me to go ahead, or somebody need to hear that this morning that you need to go ahead. Now, you need to keep on moving for for Jeremiah said. Then I will not make mention of him nor speak any more of his name that I would not even use the word of God. But look, what begins to happen in verse number 9 of chapter XX, but his word was in my heart old out."
" I got to catch that when the word of God is in your heart, in your heart. You just can't treat people any kind of way when the word of God is in your heart. You just can't live any kind of way when the word of God is in your heart. You just can't quit on God so easily but this is like fire shut up in your bones. I don't know. But you gotta listen that bibbity times. I wanted to throw in the towel that been plenty of times. I wanted to quit, but it's something about the name of Jesus."
" There's power in the name of Jesus and he is Jeremiah who came up in chapter 1 when excuses. God said, I will be with you to deliver. You can take this out. Jeremiah says,"
 Chapter 20 verse number 9 but his word was in my in my heart like a burning fire. Shut up in my bones. Woo.
" I was weary of holding it back and I could not. He said, listen, I could I could not, I can't I can't, I can't, I can't quit them. But look what he says in verse number 11 and I'm almost done in verse number 11, he says. But the Lord is with me as a mighty. Oh, awesome. 100. We serve a god, that is"
 Mighty. He's a mighty all someone there for my persecutors will stumble and will not Prevail. They will be greatly ashamed for day will not Prosper. That Everlasting confusion would never be forgotten. Can I help you on today? That we serve a mighty all someone that will fight our battles that will fight our situations that only thing he
" Says that the battle is not yours but it's the Lord that if we continue to trust God in spite of what's going on in our life that. Yeah, that would be times where we feel like giving up. Yeah, that would be times where we feel like throwing in the towel, but we have to remember it's in our heart to serve the Lord, and once you understand that it is not about you. Once you understand is not about people, but it's all about the relationship, you have with Jesus Christ that he gives you that."
" Wanting that empowering power to serve him like never before you will, then understand that. I feel like the songwriters. I feel like going on. The I have our work to do for he has purpose me for not only, he has he called me by name, but he knows me, he knows me, he have qualified me. He got stir this and God has qualified you to do. Our awesome work. That isn't it? What might be hard for others? God with"
" God's power, it would be easy for God is with you no matter what. So I want you to know today that God is a mighty, all someone that he knows you now only he knows you but he has a plan and a purpose for your life that you are qualified to go through. What you're going through that. Listen, it might see wealth, it might seem"
" But we serve an awesome guy. He said he would never. Leave us nor forsake us. God is so awesome. That he gave his only begotten son, who humbly to God, but rose with all power, that saving power. That healing power that Deliverance power. I know sometimes he get rough y'all, and we want to throw in, but you have to, we want to throw in the towel. But we have to be reminded that God has a purpose and a plan for how long"
" That he is a mighty, awesome one but the Lord is with me. The Lord is with you. I know it hurts. Sometimes, I know it doesn't make any sense some time that life has a way of getting the best of us. But we have to remember for God is with us, no matter what he's with us, that we can do all things through"
" Through Christ, who strengthens us. Just remember that we serve an awesome God and he's a mighty Jeremiah said, he's a mighty all. Someone don't lose sight of that. When Trouble Comes don't lose sight of whatever's going on around you. Yeah, we have a way of quitting quitting is more easier than going forth, but we trust God he can do it for us. If you trust God he can do it for us. God, let me see."
 What you see in me. That should be your prayer this morning. God. Let me see what you see in me for some time. I see myself losing but you see me having a victory. You see me? Having a victory. You see me winning?
" Oh my God. Let me see what you see in me. I'm fired up now, I'm not burned out, but I know. God has purpose. Not only for my life, but for yours for do you before you was informing your mother's womb. He knew you, he had a plan and purpose for your life. God bless you. My Heavens smile upon you."
"Good morning. My name is faster. Off the porter. I'm the pastor Boswell, Chapel Baptist Church in Greensboro Georgia. I'm excited to bring you a word today, and I hope all is well with you quickly. I just want to encourage you on today. Sometimes you get rough. Sometimes you get hard, but God he's in control and he loves you more beyond measure, only thing. He calls us to do, just to trust him and leaned I to our own"
" understanding and you try to figure out things on our own, but quickly that's going to a word of prayer gracious. Father, we thank you, Lord. God for this opportunity to give your name to praise the glory and all the honor. We thank you. Lord, God for things as well as they are. Lord God, we understand that there are people who are going through on today for God and they need your powers or God. They need to rest, or God, give them rest. Lord God give them. Peace, law. God, give them"
" God. Do I write now? Give them healing in their body. The woke up, we believe though God that you can heal the landlord God, whatever they dealing with. So we just pray, Lord going today. That this word be our own time word or Rhema word. Lord, God refreshing word. Lord God to help someone on their Journey, though. God to remind them that will God that you're still an awesome, God, that you are Mighty God. And we say this prayer in Jesus name. Amen? Again, I'm excited today to just bring"
" Bring an encouraging word, it would be coming from the book of Isaiah. Isaiah, the fortieth chapter a man is so familiar text chapter 40 verses, 28 through 31 and so often that we hate to wait. Amen. But God has called us some things. We have to wait on, Amen? And we can be impatient, but God calls us to be more patient."
" Amen. For there is one of the fruit of the spirit that we must have long-suffering. Amen. And look what he says. In Isaiah the twenty-eighth chapter under the 40, the fortieth chapter XXVIII verse to the 31st verse, it says, have you not known? Have you not heard the Everlasting? God, the Lord. The creator of the ends of the Earth. Neither Faith nor is"
" Here, his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the weak and to those who have no might he increases strength. Even the youths, shall faint, and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall. But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall Mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be"
" Be weary they shall walk and not faint. Amen. I'm just want to talk from the thought, waiting with expectation. Waiting with expectation. It's so important that we learn to wait on the Lord that we live in a society that everything is instantly. Everything is quick, you order something, you can get it in one or two days back. Can I tell you? I really don't like to wait in line."
" I don't like to wait on a package. Listen II, awaiting is something II have to work or work on but God even to our prayers, cause us to wait, amen. That sometimes we might not get an instant breakthrough. So what God tells us in the midst of our waiting that we still should serve, we still should give God the glory we should still continue to lie."
" Live as God has called us to live but we'll find in today's text. Isaiah is the author. And Isaiah means god is salvation in the Old Testament. Salvation is different from the New Testament. Salvation Old Testament, salvation deals with deliverance from danger from enemies. But Old Testament, it were what you call more physical. But New Testaments have"
" Said, it's more of a spiritual sense. It's emphasized on being delivered from Eternal separation. But here's what we call today. This, this salvation got God wants us to be delivered. Amen, he wants to Deliver Us from whatever is going on in our lives, but I know someone is looking today and saying that you never been where you did."
" Supposed to be that I might not be talking to you, I know that but some people here that looking own virtual and saying that they always made the right decision. But can I tell you about, how you ever, huh being where you did supposed to be? That's it, that's something should have broken off. You have left the club just in time. And as soon as you left the club, yeah, begin to fight me."
" To break out, someone got shot and and and, and you left just in time. That's, that's Old Testament, salvation. That's Old Testament salvation. Where God will come and rescue, you, and deliver you from certain situation. But in the text today, the people of God was in captivity. Yeah, the Bible say they were in captivity for 70 years because they didn't listen to"
" God. So authors that when we don't listen to God, things begin to happen in our lives that we try to figure it out. We try to work it out. We try to do it in our own strength but we are finding that God want us to totally rely on him."
" The people God now because of that disobedient, there was in captivity because they didn't listen to God and let us consider for a moment. Could it be as we look at our own life and find ourself in certain places? We didn't think we were going to be in for a long time. Could it be the reason that we are still down because we didn't listen to God. Why? Why one baby, why are you are at"
" In what situation going on in your life. Is because of the fact, you probably didn't listen to God. If you don't think, sometimes we have to live with the consequences of our choices for a long time, then ask someone who have a child with somebody. They don't like, oh, I just ask somebody. Huh? That have a child with somebody, they don't like, don't you?"
" That you can't live with the consequences of your choices for a long time. There's my happy dance from people who have hooked up with some people who just supposed to have been a season thing, but have made things permanent and they can't stand them now because we have did some things that was not according to God, but we did it on our own selfish ways. If you don't think you have to live with consequences of your choices for a"
 Time. Ask somebody that married some as someone that marries somebody.
" That they didn't supposed to marry that that now they they find themselves struggling. They find themselves that they already have that backpack but they haven't left yet. That there's some people are in relationship. They don't supposed to be in, but they find themselves and made a bad choice and they living out the consequences for a long time. If you don't think you can live with consequences of"
" Trust it for a long time as somebody who had money, but didn't spend it wisely and now they're suffering. They trying to recoup but they can't get it back. Yeah, the decisions. The choices we make it happen. Can have a lasting effect. So that's why we have to be careful in the decisions we make. I want to let you know today."
" That the first 39 chapter of Isaiah was Isaiah, was reading to tell. If you just listen to God,"
" You wouldn't have been in captivity and it's kind of help somebody today. If you just listen to God, if save you a lot of pain, it save you. A lot of Anguish, it will save you a lot of confused. If you just listen to God that, that the decision you make. Now it's so important that it can cause you to be stuck with someone. You don't even smoke to be with you."
" Just one minute season. I think now, you they're permanent."
 Hm.
" because,"
 We have made some bad decisions. It's easy to say the devil did it or somebody else calls me to be this way.
 I believe there are times and I'll pass we have heard a little voice but we are knowing it and we choose to do what we want to do.
" And now we're living with the consequences. Some people were again just seasonal but we made permanent a little horse said you don't need him. A little voice said you don't need her. That little voice said that night, stay at home. Don't spend your money huh. A rainy day is coming."
" But will find that God always gives us a way to escape, but it is up to us to take this cape that that little voice you were here. It wasn't that but the Holy Spirit trying to tell you it's going to cause you pain that plagues are going to cost you. Hmm. It's going to cost you so much more"
" But in the text of chapter 40, God is so faithful. Even though we mess up, he will never leave you or he would never leave us nor forsake us. Can I tell you? And verse number 28, look what it says. It says, in chapter 47. Verse number, 20 chapter 40 of Isaiah. It says, have you not known? Have you not heard?"
" The Everlasting God. The Lord. Can I tell you? It's good to know who God is. It is good to know that trouble. Don't last always. It is so important that you don't lose sight of who God is for. God didn't bring you this far to leave you. But listen, I want you to understand God is Not mocked. Whatever a man. So that way it he shall reap. You do not get away with anything the"
" This is up today, we're so important that we will cause the consequences of tomorrow, and here's God saying, have you not heard? Have you not heard as I say, have you not heard? Have you have, you not known that everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the Earth neither sinks nor is weary. Oh man, what an awesome God."
" He's so awesome that we ought to know that he's a everlasting. God, we all to know that we are only here for a period of time, but he lives ah Everlasting, he's Everlasting that that that we are only here for a brief moment but we serve a God that was here for he is time and before time for he's the author and the finisher of our faith."
" That is so important that you know today that who God is to you that who's God to you and your life we can. So often blame other people why we turn out the way we are? We often blame people why the decision we made, why we turn out the way we turn out, but in reality that these are the choices you made but God is so faithful."
" He's so faithful y'all. He said, he'll forgive you of all your sins and cleanse, you of all unrighteousness. So it doesn't matter what you have done this day. You have to know, God for yourself. You have to know God for yourself or we are still in a pandemic and we can get comfortable and doing nothing. We can still be blessed and still, miss out on the move of God for, we still believe since everything is okay."
" The god gets the minimum but everybody else gets the maximum but it shouldn't be that way. We should give God our best. For here's Isaiah said, have you not known? Have you not heard the Everlasting? God, he's the Creator. But can I tell you more? People worship the blessings more than the blesser most people? Let me catch it. I want you to catch this most people."
" Worship the blessings, more than the blesser."
 He's the Creator for will find that.
" His understanding is unsearchable. He knows everything. Until the Bible said, darkness is like to God, he sees what you do, you don't, he's an all-knowing. God, you we don't get away with anything so it's good to know. Dad God for yourself for in verse number 29. He says he gives power."
" To the weak. Can I help somebody today that every now and then we get weep, listen, nobody comes to church every Sunday with all strength. Sometimes we come with a little bit of weakness and we need a little help. Can I help somebody today? Why do we get wheat? Because we try to take on too much and trying to do too much."
" We'll worry about these. We're trying to figure out how this going to happen, how we going to do this. But the Bible tells us that we should cast all our cares, upon God for, he careth for us for that. This battle is not yours. I'm reminded that. And second Chronicles chapter, 20 dinner with Kim."
" Jehoshaphat in verse number 17 he said something so profound that God was through there, through God speaking through the people through his pocket, this what God said to them. And I want to share this with you this morning. It says this in second Chronicles chapter, 20 verse 17, you will not need to fight in this battle."
 You will not need to fight in this battle. He says position yourself.
" Stand still and see the salvation of the lord. I want you to know brothers and sisters on this morning, you will not need to fight in this bag. Only thing you have to do is position Yourself and Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord. So often we trying to fight in the Bible. But the verse 15 accept and second Chronicles chapter 20 and tells me the battle is not yours but it"
" Lower that. So often we try to take the place of God, we try to work it out. And can I tell you, God wants you to seek Him in everything, for he give power to the week, but not only that, he says into those who have no power that those who have no might he increases strength only thing. One God only thing I wanted to do on this morning for y'all. It's for you to just trust him."
" That have that relationship with him what more God has to do to prove that, he's a good guy that he's a faithful God. What what more God has to prove to you that he's on your side. What more you have to do to show you that he loves you."
 Wow.
 We'll find that he gives people. He's God will give power to the week. Why are you acting like you strong? Why are you acting like? He stole God will give power to the week.
" Some people are weak as water and they still won't give it to God, but God is so faithful. Y'all listen, I'm reminded that we spend a lot of time trying to tell everybody how to be strong when we don't know that we get our power."
" From the Lord. We get, we always try to tell people what to do and how to overcome situation. If I were you, I would do this. But can I tell you? You got to give that thing to God. For God is so awesome that that sometimes we get weak, sometimes we feel like, is it all worth it? But God gives power. Hmm."
" To the week, stop pretending that you got it all together. It doesn't impress me. I want somebody to say that I ain't got it together. II know. I need the Lord help. That's when God can use. You win? When you're poor in spirit. That that you feel that though? I can't do this but without you. Hmm, what an awesome God, we serve"
" Let me tell you what strength is when you say, father, I stretch my hands to the no other help. I know if you withdraw your hands from me. Where should I go? But we"
" Want to go around and say like, hey, I'm blessed and highly favored. No, no, no, I need your help. Lord God, I know bless how to say, but I know that some things, some errors in my life and that I cannot do it on my own, I need you to strip them in. I need to be stronger than God for you for. This is throwing me. This is getting the best of me every time I see him. I just shake my head. Every time I look at my it doesn't make sense to me. And every time I said, I wanted this."
 Welcome. I know they were wrong.
" You wait, but God said I give you power. He said I'm not going to change your situation but I changed you in your situation which people used to mess you up. When you are shaking your head you said God bless them. Anyway God do it for me. Anyway, God has a way of changing the way. We see things the way it says in the Bible that"
" In chapter number, 40, verse number 30, it says, even the youth shall faint and be weary."
" In the young, Misha early fall, man listen. Listen remember, being young? Even the youth, get tired. Even at full strength, you can get weird, even if you have all your, you can get weary. But the Bible says in Galatians 6 and 9, it says, and let us not be weary and we're doing for in due season."
 We shall reap. If we faint not.
" Don't give up guys so much for you. I am not time. I materialistic stuff because I need peace. Y'all II need your, I need healing in my body and I don't know about you but I need something from the Lord more than a car. A house material. Well II need that. Peace that passes all understanding. I don't know about you. It'd be nice to have the bill paid back. Can I tell you? It never like piece."
" Going to a job, have peace. Some people when they go to their job, their don't have, they don't do. They do not have peace. When some time with some people walk into their house, they don't have peace. I don't know about you, but I need the Everlasting peace of God. For one thing about God, the door that the Lord has give us the word and give it to us, and the world can't take it away. So, I need his peace and his joy, and his healing more than anything."
 for I realize that God is able to do some things the way he says he says
" In verse 31 but those who wait on the Lord. Here we go. Now here we go to wait means to stay where you want is to. Wait means to stay. Where one is mean it that you just position yourself and you just keep on trusting God, I know you prayed about it. I know you ask other people to pray about it but you just stay there and position yourself."
" Listen. Listen. Listen stand still well how you stood by Serve by little, but I'd still trusting God and it is. See that God will move on your behalf. You might be saying, well, I've been praying the prayer for pastor for years. Hey, it ain't over to God says is. Okay, just continue to trust him for. God, will do it for you. And can I tell you on today? He can renew your strength for. He said, if you're waiting on the Lord and he said now,"
" Only your weight but you wait with anticipation. This is a strong believe that something will happen and can I help somebody when you come to God, you got to believe something going to happen. You just can't just pray and sit and don't sit down on it. But you have to pray and say God, I know you're able you did it for me back in 1989. You got to go way back. You did it for me and 91 you get got to call that thing like India. You will you deliver me when I was going through your pay, you"
" I have money. My money, got funny and you made a way you got to remember what God has done for you and you have to anticipate the I know that you're able to do it for. There's nothing too hard for you God. So I'm just trusting you in the midst of everything that's going on he says huh. But those who wait on the Lord whoo-hoo he just tell you the weight. I know you don't want to wait. I know you hate waiting. I've nobody God is saying today. If"
" You just wait on me, not. That's like never before that. God can move on your behalf like never before he said, but this requires you to wait, this requires you to have patients that that I know that you want, instant relief. But he says that God says. But if you wait, he said he shall renew you. He said, he shall renew your strength. I don't know about you that I need my strength, renewed daily."
" He says this shrimp, you'll be like a eagle. He said it shall Mount up with wings like an eagle and I don't know about you, but you are able to soar over your problems. You'll be able to soar over your situation. You'll be able to soar over anything that comes in. It comes your way because you'll be leaving, listen toys, you had your head towards the sky, you had your head towards the heels before which cometh your help for the if you continue to"
" To lift up your head that you can soar over in situation. If you continue to look toward God, you can sew over any situation that comes your way for. He's able to renew your spirit. He able to renew your mind that he begins to tell us that. Now, I know they've done you wrong. I know it looks bad, but you are able to handle it. You're able to go through it because God has renewed your spirit need. You can be like the songwriter. I feel"
" Like going on, huh? I don't know about you, but I feel like going on for. I serve a God. That can renew me, huh? He can do a new thing in me, huh? I don't know about you, huh? People might have counted you out, but God is doing a new thing at you and you ought to praise him right there, huh. If God is doing a new thing, you do in your life, you ought to give him glory. What you used to do, you find yourself not doing what used to throw you. You're not finding yourself thrown for God has renewed your"
" Have a renewed strength means I can mount up with wings like an eagle. In other words, the weeds caused me to rise above situation, above people and things of my past that some people are trapped in their past. Some people are dealing with stuff that that Linda passed, get the best of them. They still or any new season, but they haven't. But they have brought in Old baggage that, and they can't recognize their in the new season because their past. Whoa."
" The past are still holding them, but God is saying this morning that he's doing a new thing in your life. Only thing you have to do is just trust him for the fact that he's doing, he's doing a new thing. You only thing, he said that's trust him in the midst of your situation. Here's his Isaiah, telling the people that God gonna renew you are you are in a bad situation. Now you ain't captivity but God is going to renew."
" Anu your strength, I don't know about you. That is good news because he began to say he shall renew their strength. They shall Mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary. I don't know about you but I think I went on and see what the end going to be. I've been on this journey too long to give up now, but I'm online on and see what the end don't be. Hit anybody with me to this morning that you're going to run on."
" Is see what the end is going to be. He said we got to not only one and I will be able to run and not be weary but he says they shall walk and not Faith. Whoo. Can I tell somebody you might not be able to run, but you've been able to walk in love, you'll be able to walk in Victory. You will be able to walk enjoy, you'll be able to walk in peace. You'll be able to stand still and know that the Lord is on your side. That that"
" When you walk that something begins to happen when you move forward, something begins to happen. It remind me of those ten lepers that that when they begin to walk to the priest, they begin to be healed. When you begin to walk in the things of God, God are beginning to drop some things off. You are beginning to drop those burdens off. You, I don't know about you. What an awesome God, we serve that. He's able to deliver you. From any situation that this is the day, the Lord has made and ice."
" That we Joyce and be glad in for, he's able to renew me. Have you not heard? Have you not know who God is? He's the Everlasting God. I don't know about you, but God is about to turn that thing around. He's about to renew your spirit, he's about to do a new thing in your family that if you just trust him in this word today and wait with anticipation, knowing that God is gonna do it for you. I'm excited today because I'm expecting great things for God. He has not he's not finished with me yet."
" He's not finished with you but you have to have the spirit of expectation knowing that God is able. You got to learn to walk by faith and not by sight. I know it look rough. I know I look rough around you but but listen. Listen, don't let that get the best of you through some of our God is bigger than that. Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us make his name be great. So, I know that he's bigger than any situation that you can make it that he's bigger than cancer. He's bigger than diabetes, he bit."
" This hyper person, he's bigger than anything that you're dealing with that. He's able to renew your spirit for God. So loved the world. He gave his only begotten son, who humbly died."
" But rolls with all power that saving power. That healing power that Deliverance power. Listen, it get rough sometimes y'all and we get weak. But God, give us power that you think that you can't overcome that, you need somebody that you need what you need? You need that cigarette. You do need that we do. Need that alcohol. You, you need that, man. You need them."
 It feel like you cannot live without certain things.
" But God said, I give you power today to overcome anything. He said, listen, you got to seek me first in everything you do."
" Not your bestie. God wants you totally complete. He want to totally, he won't all of you. Not some of you, he don't want no High, Praise."
 You don't know how half a prayer garden. Thank you again. He won't you totally surrender to him.
 For God says I can renew your strength today.
 I'm able to do it.
" But you have to have the relation ship, you must realize who God is, you must recognize who God is for. God is able to do everything, but fail."
" May have a smile upon you, and I just pray that something was said on this morning to help you on your journey for those who, wait, on the Lord."
 Shall renew their strength.
 Be renewed on today by the love of God knowing that he's with you. It get rough sometimes y'all but we got to trust God for nothing catches God by surprise in Jesus name. I do. Pray that he keeps you. That he covers you that he smiles upon you today. God bless you may have a smile upon you.
"Good morning. My name is Pastor. Otto Porter. I'm the pastor of Boswell, Chapel Baptist Church in Greensboro Georgia. I just bring you, greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who is the same yesterday today? And forever. More, I'm excited today because this is my third, pastor Pastor real anniversary. I'm excited to be a part of the"
" The balls wailing and family. Amen, and balls, will Chapel Baptist Church. We just going to grow and we just won't go higher in the Lord. But own today, I just want to encourage you that that everything you do as a Christian be about Jesus Christ. It's so important that we do not lose sight on who what purpose and playing that that he has for us quickly. Let's go into word of Prayer."
" Gracious. Father, we thank you Lord. God for this opportunity lower guy to hear from you. Lord God, I pray that one guy that it be a Rhema word that it'd be a long time. World refreshing word, Lord, God, that Lord God, it will touch the hearts of your people. We understand. Lord, God. That there are some, there's some people are going through or God on this morning. Oh my god, there are some sick and shedding a little God. And although we ask you, Lord, God to heal the Land O. God, we ask you to be with their family, so I'll go"
" I can Comfort them as they go through the Lord God, we understand their Sunbury family. So God in the community, we asked you to cover them all. God Comfort them right now that the family stayed together, Lord God, we just pray, Lord, God, that this world be preached, clearly that it bring Comfort to your people daddy. Bring confirmation that you're still an awesome. God that you're still a mighty God, you still a faithful God and you still loving God, in Jesus name."
" I do pray, amen. Again, I just want to encourage you on today again. I'm excited to be the pastor of balls. Will Chapel Baptist Church. It is such an honor and a humble experience. A man to lead a great people, a man but God has a word for us on this morning and it comes out of the book of Colossians."
" Yes. And this probably one of my favorite scriptures scripture when it deals with Paul encouraging, the people at collages. Well, in chapter 3, verse 23 and 24, it reads and whatever you do, do it heartily as to the Lord and not to men knowing that from the Lord you will."
" The reward of the inheritance for you, serve the Lord Christ."
" I want to talk from the thought this morning. What I want to talk to him without this morning, let it let it all. Be about Jesus. Let it all be about. Jesus, that we should let him lead her Us in everything we do for. He is the author and the finisher of our faith. Paul wrote the letter, this letter, this show. The Believers. That"
 That we have everything we need and that need in Christ. Paul wrote this letter to the church on how to live and how to work as Christians. Can I be honest with you this morning that working as a Christian is not the easiest thing to do. Sometimes if you can be honest with me to that sometimes being a deacon is
" Not the easiest thing to do being a musher is not the easy. Easiest thing to do being a teacher, it's not the easiest thing to do. Being a quad member is not the easiest thing to do. And being a pastor is definitely not the easiest thing to do better. Paul gives us a blueprint and on a clear and concise as ample on how we should work."
" The text says, whatever you do."
" Whatever you do working out working with all your heart. In other words, some time as a Christian Duty it can be so demanding, it causes us. It cause the old faithfulness to fade, it causes your dedication, to dwindle, it causes your willingness to weaken. But this Duty as a"
" To it, calls us some time to lose our passion to lose our Zeal, even to lose our spirit fire. Well Spirit, fire goes out. That's why I come here this morning on assignments. And tell you, whatever, you do, let it be all about Jesus. So we can lose heart on what's going on that sometimes. The best things, sometimes the things in life,"
" Get sometimes, get the best of us and we have to remember as in the text whatever you do, do it heartily as to the Lord and not to me that everything you do should be all about Jesus. My first point I want to share with you this morning. Is you need to understand who you serve. You need to understand who you serving we're making progress, not Perfection. There's"
" One perfect. Can I tell you? But we can make progress in knowing who Jesus is Paul. Wanted to Colossians, the Colossians Church to grow spiritually in order to advance the kingdom, work as not to get confused or distracted. You have to know what team you're playing for."
" I'm reminded of a story of a little boy. He, he was on a new basketball team and he will playing against his old team. He was on a new basketball team playing against his old team. The little boy rally got into the games and he often found himself on the bench not paying attention distracted."
" It was the last game of the season, so the coast decide to put the little boy in for a couple of seconds, the little boy began to be little more begin to dribble the ball, down the court and the entire gym. Some of those, someone was screaming, go go, what, and why others were streaming know."
" No. No. And a little boy, took a shot and scored."
" And the coat in the other players they had this look on their face and asked the little boy went over and said, hey Coke, I asked or but the coach asked him. Why did you score for the other team in the little boy reply? I forgot what team I was playing for being unaware of what team you're playing."
" And for well of the other team to get the victory, can I tell you? Dad on today, you got to know who you serving for. You can't allow the enemy to get the victory. How do you allow the devil to get the victory with Deacon? Stop serving when choir requires have singing songs when mother stopped being examples of"
" The ladies when teachers stop preparing lessons, how do the devil get the victory? When intercessory Ministry, stop praying when Pastor stop studying are praying, we give the devil's a victory. Well, we give the devil the victory when we lose sight of who Jesus. Is so only this morning, you got to know who you are serving, Who You Are."
" Service for you got to understand that everything you do should be about Jesus. Ah, I want to let you know today, they're not only you need to understand who you're serving, but when you understand who you said, you need to serve unconditionally, Paul is telling the Colossians Church, they should not let anything come between them and the Lord, if you are Christian, you have"
" Have to give it all. You got brothers and sisters. You need to know who you're serving. You need to know who you're serving and you should serve on conditionally. It's not about me. And that's what you have to make it. You have to say, it's not about me, but it's all about him and that's why we must give him the glory, we may never Boswell, and this is whoever is tuning in and God bless"
" You never lose sight of Jesus Christ, because there's some things designed to throw us. That something is designed to take us out the race. And you have to stay focused on Jesus. Can I tell you? I already said in the beginning, of the sermon being a Christian is not the easiest thing to do, but it will be more harder that if you take your eyes off of Jesus,"
" You have to serve unconditionally, it's not about me, you have to get, you have to understand. Sometimes you have to get the church early and Bambi be the last one to leave that serving unconditionally serve unconditionally is a having a worship experience and becoming more important"
" Being a participant. Then a spectator that's what serving unconditionally that when you understand that, it's not about you. When you understand that, whatever you do, it's all about the glory of God, that you should give God your best. Why? Because he woke you up this morning and clothed you in your right mind? That's far enough. Should be enough. Praise right now, to give him some praise."
" Raise that what God has done for you that that some people had plan on waking up this morning, didn't wake up and you ought to thank God for this is the day that the Lord has made that you shall rejoice and be glad in it but you shouldn't be bitter because he has given you, another chance to Mercy and Grace. That's why we have to serve unconditionally."
" You have to smoke that when people make you mad, even when things don't go your way, you still have to serve unconditionally and when you still have to give your all to Christ and sometimes people would treat you like I don't know. They will twist and Shake you. It sometime people will treat you like a doorbell. They will push to see how you were."
" And sometimes people would treat you like a doormat that was step on your feelings. So you have to remind yourself that that is not about me. So what God has for me, is for me. And you have to remind yourself that he didn't bring you this far to leave. You, I need somebody to understand that you need to understand this morning who you're serving and when you know who you're serving you cancer,"
 Serve unconditionally I'm simply saying regardless what I have to go through unwilling to serve Jesus and give him Mom.
" Can I tell you that would be moments where you will feel like, giving up on this journey when you are looking, you look through and say this and look back and say this, God has brought me a mighty long way. And can I tell you? It's so important that we are in position on today that we get in line that what God has for us that we don't miss out on the people. He have us to be connecting to"
" Yeah, you are only Simon, you have to remind you not to be remember me - let me remind you that, that some people God has assigned to you that you supposed to be in position that you supposed to be in place to encourage them to lift them up. You supposed to be in place, to be that example. I'm trying to help somebody that you don't go, go, get so big head, don't get so full of yourself. That is digging this all about you, but God has lined up things."
" These for you to do and be in place. So, when you're out of place you miss, I don't know blesses. You might say well I'm doing good so far. Yeah, yeah, you might be but you listened, you missing out on what God has for you. When you let it become personal when you let it be about you. That's why in Colossians 20? And child Colossians chapter 3, 23, he says, and whatever you do"
" I'm a Christian I'm, come on, Christian, whatever you do, do it with your whole heart as to the Lord and not to men in other way. We should have the spirit of Excellence that we should be like, listen, I whatever I'm doing. I'm not doing the police you Pastor? I'm not doing it that power. Please. You the Usher the Deacon, but I'm doing it unto the Lord for, I understand that if I do it for him. So when I look at me and mess up, I can still"
" Be able to not be thrown. I can still be able to good kareo for, I can pray for them for. I understand that God has me in the position that I can be a Steal of Force that I can make a difference in someone like so often we give up because we see other people fall to the Wayside and we base our relationship with God because"
" If somebody else Misfortune, no, you supposed to have a relationship with Jesus Christ. You listen, you're the one who kept you, don't want you saying that, that you going to pick up your cross and deny yourself and follow Jesus. You said that."
" But it's so important that you don't lose sight on the ministry that God has for you. Yes, you have a Ministry inside of you. You have a gift inside of you but you will never know what it is until you continue to seek God. And when you see God, you'll be able to be great. How you can be great by seeking God because he say, anybody who wants to be great, let them become a servant."
" First. You gotta know who you serve. Exactly. Once you realize your servant easy. You must serve unconditional. I don't care what? Come your way. You got this steel stand up bowling for God, for he been so good."
" But not only that, you need to understand who you're serving, but sir, if I'm conditioning, but I want to remind you this morning. There are some bonus for your service. Oh, I don't know about you, but there's a bonus for your service. Yeah, you gave. You probably receive a stimulus. Check and listen. You didn't have to serve to get that bonus. But can I tell you, God, got something way more bigger than the stimulus check."
" I just want you to understand something this morning, Dad God is able to blow your mind. He could do a ceiling abundantly more, you can think or ask the more than you can even imagine."
 But you have to be in position.
" And you have to understand that God has purpose for your life. Somebody out of even just say it's not about me, you are driving type that right there. It's not about me, it's all about Jesus. You are the mean that when you said it's not about me cuz I'm going to serve God Faithfully. Even if things don't go my way, I'm going to still continue to serve him so he been too good for them to me to let go."
" That's a bonus for your service but look what it says in verse number 20, for our Chapter 3 of collages knowing that from the Lord, you will receive the reward of they Heritage for you sir. The Lord Christ, y'all got to understand who you're serving your serving the lord"
" And when you serve the Lord, that's when you can serve people. Uh-oh, gotta catch that. Y'all gotta catch that receiving your inheritance shows. You're connecting to someone that has something worth giving that God has something worth. Giving to receive inheritance shows, you are connected to someone that has something worth giving also shows."
 You are worthy of that gift.
" I want to be worthy of that gift. Paul wanted the church in Colossians to know. If you continue to work for the Lord, the work. The Lord is going to hook you up. If you continue to work on it all and I cannot tell you it's not always gonna be easy, it's not always going to be what you wanted to be. Remember I said at the beginning of the sermon being a Christian is not the easiest thing to do. But if you relax"
" On the love of God. If you rely on who Jesus don't work of Jesus Christ on the cross, you were there, understand that he got something in store for me that he's all over me and keeping me alive."
 Paul is simply saying that your labor is not in vain.
" Your name might not be in lights, your name may not be on a plaque or certificate or given to you for your service. You might never. It might never be the way you want it to be. Maybe listen to me that you may never get a pat on the back or banquet in your in your honor. But I want you to"
" I want to encourage you to keep working for the Lord, keep working for the Lord, and do not lose sight on who he is for, I rather have the reward from the Savior, then the recognition from the Saints, probably catch that. I rather have the reward from the Savior, then the recognition from the Saints for. I understand that God has great things."
" In store for me that if I stay in line with him that I have, I recognized who I'm serving the most high God and I began to still serve unconditionally. No matter what's going on around me? No matter what, it's going in the ministry. The app has to still come. I have to still serve unconditionally and for that is our bonus for my service for one day, I just believe he's going to call me."
" To Glory, I just believe one day that he has prepared a place for me where there's no more dying, no, more crying, no more pain than listen. Listen, no more bad news. Can I tell you that? God has an inheritance for us, but I just believe he has great things for us before he called us to glory to that, he's able to do exceedingly. Abundantly above all more than we can think."
" Our ass. You just have to believe that for yourself, but you have to remember do not lose sight of what's going on around you for we as Christians should walk by faith. Not by sight do not let what's goes on around you stop what God has for you."
 Whatever you do.
 Do it.
" To the glory of God, do it for the glory of Jesus. For God, gave His only begotten son, who home bled and died and Rose with all power. That saving power that Deliverance, power that healing power. Listen, he can do it for you. I'm a living witness that God. He Keeps On Doing Great Things that if we begin to do what God says the Lord listen."
" We will begin to make progress, not Perfection, that God will honor that that. Well the Bible tells us and whatever we do, do it heartily as to the Lord and not to me. Well, if you got to please, man, you already lost the battle. So we should be not men Pleasers but we should be a god-pleasing. And so can I tell you all today?"
" That God tells us that knowing that from the Lord, you will receive the reward of the inheritance for your for you serve the Lord Christ. Remember that that you serve the Lord Christ for he listened, he have great things for us and he's about to take you higher. He's about to take you higher in your ministry. He's about to take to hire everything around. You is going to win."
" For, I believe this is your winning season, but you have to be connected with Jesus and do not lose sight when things get rough."
" Sir know who you serve serve unconditionally. But not only that, there's a bonus for your service. I just pray that something was said on today, I offer Christ to you today. That is, he says in his word, anybody that calls on the name of Jesus shall be saved for God, gave for God, so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son."
" Whosoever, no matter who you are, no matter what you've done, no matter what you have, what you, how you living now, but whosoever, believe shall not perish, but have everlasting life. We just need to believe in Jesus, and you are Heaven bound, but he has called us to live a certain way that we should live as our past. But we would be"
 Come new creatures.
 So I just pray that something was said on today that they help you on your journey that don't lose sight. Keep on serving for serving the lord will pay off. After a while. God bless you. My Heavens smile upon you.
"Good morning, Facebook family, and friends. This is Pastor, Willie Chester wishing everyone. Everywhere, a good and godly morning, and this morning our word and worship on behalf of st. Paul Baptist Church coming from Romans the eighth chapter."
" T7. Romans 8 and 37 and then we'll look at Romans also Romans the 8th chapter. Excuse me. Yeah. Eighth chapter 14 through 17, amen. Amen. So if you would get your Bibles for Romans 8:37 and also Romans 8:14 through 17,"
 This morning we're talking about how we are more than conquerors. Good morning Lisa good morning. Say good morning and just a little encouragement for us this morning. Before we get started just like to send out well wishes and a speedy recovery to our good fin friend. Pastor Joseph Hurley who was in an accident on Friday and we just want to send
" up prayers his way and wish him a speedy recovery. Also also part of our church family, the southern Spice, Girls Zion and 2D or in competition today in Carrollton, Georgia. And we wish them a good time and and safe competition and the moms and dads and wish them a good trip back as well. So y'all this morning, just a little, just a little"
" Judgment, as we get ready for this week, and if you have any prayer, requests, anything, good morning, sister. Wanda. Good morning, sister. Iona we're also on my page and on Facebook on Saint Paul page. So either place you can catch us invite somebody. Let him know there's an encouraging word about to go out, about to go out. So you have any prayer requests, anything for later on. As we end this."
" Service. Please please put them on the screen and let us know and we'll be more than happy to to include them in our prayers. So before we get started everybody let's get let's go to the Lord in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father we thank you so much for this day. Lord for this opportunity this chance is time to start our week off, right to worship with you. And with with our loved ones and master, we just come right now asking that you would encourage a"
 Arts through this word this morning that you would give us what we need to keep us sustain us throughout this day and also throughout the week to come not knowing what the week will bring but we know that you will bring the week and know that you will get us through. So Lord we thank you in advance. For I wonder for this word is going to touch us. It's in Jesus name we pray amen. Amen and amen. Amen. Good. So y'all have you ever wondered what the
" Statement, we are more than conquerors means and a lot of people get discouraged on this Christian walk and I know I do sometimes looking at the suffering and looking at all the things that we have to go through. But but y'all God has a reason. God has a reason and a purpose for everything, we go through. So good morning Brenda. Good morning brother Kenny. So this morning, we want to look at Romans 8:37"
" And then Romans want to end up with Romans 8:14 through 17. So if you have your Bibles, the word of God says nay or no, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us and just a setup. Verse chapter 8, Paul, he gives an explanation of all the things that we may have to endure as Christians and he and all throughout."
" Throughout Romans he he sets it up and lets us know that that things won't be perfect on our Christian walk. And and that's where a lot of people get discouraged because they see things going on. And sometimes we may tend to blame God for things, but but y'all just because we're Christians, and even though we are believers, we still face the same challenges that everyone else faces and those challenges sometimes include suffering of some"
" But here's a good news. Good morning, Pam. The good news is that no matter what difficulties appear in our lives. Romans 8:38 837 reminds us that Jesus already has given us Eternal salvation. And the future, that we have with him is glorious. And now watch this. Now, y'all God wants to be father, to all, but everybody wanted exception."
" Oh, can we just be real with that? God wants to be the father of all, but everybody won't won't accept him but but but as we come to him, as we cry out to him, as little children, know that our God hears and knows and will honor our faithfulness. Everybody that says, they love God, they don't love God, but the proof is through the suffering, through the tests and trials."
" That's the real proof. Now, if we look at this Romans 8:38 and scuse me 37, he says, and all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved he names, trials, tribulations, persecution. He named all the things that we may have to go through and in a fleshly mind from from an Earthly perspective, Paul's statement doesn't seem to make any sense. It seems"
" This passage is saying that, no matter what happens in our lives, that God will will will make it alright, that, that, that God will will just just, just give us. This, put us in a place where we won't have to experience in his suffering, but y'all that is, that is not true, but but the other way that Paul puts it, that may seem crazy to us is that he says we're more than conquerors. Good morning, Dianna"
" We're talking about Romans 8:37. He says, good morning. Pam Mitchell. It! He says that, that the person who believes in God through Jesus Christ, is more than a conqueror. Then maybe someone who is an emperor, someone who may be a king and you may look like I do sometimes. I get discouraged and I see people that I know are doing wrong."
" See them. It seems like they're getting over. It seems like they're getting through. It seems like there's no consequences but but God says all know that's, that's not the case. But he says that we who believe are more than conquerors. How can we be more powerful than people with money and position and entitled and, and those that have more than we do? Ha, how can we be more more than they are? Well, here it is. The fact of the matter."
" ER, isn't that if we believe in Jesus sin, we have the promise of an eternal Kingdom, ruled by a good king or good emperor that will last forever second. Peter 111 says, for this way, there will be richly provided for you and interest into the internal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Now as Christians y'all, we do not hope and things that we"
" See, but things that are unseen. Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen y'all. That's where we are different from the world, our our faith. So, so, how does it make it? How does it make it? So that we are more than conquerors? We are more than conquerors through the blood of Jesus Christ. And not only is it for salvation. Good morning, Millicent."
" But buddy, it gives us far greater far greater rewards. We that's what gives us the ability to love our enemies. Even though they persecute us knowing, that we got something greater knowing that people who lie on us cheat US, who are people, who do us wrong, that we've got something greater to look forward to look forward to, and we're not more than conquerors. Because of our own ability, it doesn't mean that will escape the struggles and"
" Hardships and sickness of life but it is because we have something greater to hold on to get. I get a few amens gather this world is not, there is not all there is but we have a Greater Hope. Look at the landscape of things that are going on and you will get discouraged. But the good news for believers is that we have something greater. Can somebody just type in Greater, we've got something greater. We got"
" Being more to look forward to. So question, question, how does God make us more than conquerors? And y'all this? This bless my soul. So so, so listen, when a conqueror in the Bible days, when a conqueror went into a new land, they had to fight, they had to battle, they had to conquer the people for which they wanted to take the land from the follow me now. So once they did that, they"
" After the battle was fought, they still had to prove, had to prove their worth. They would still have to fight some more battles. They would still have to win over the hearts of people, but watch this now. It's only conquer the land and their heirs, HEI RS, their heirs, took possession of the land. They didn't have to fight. Or is anybody thinking spiritually? They didn't have to."
" To go into battle because of what, what what the previous person had done so as heirs, oh I wish somebody would get this as as the Bible says we are heirs and co-heirs with Jesus Christ. So what Jesus has done the Bible tells us he has conquered death, hell, and the grave and has prepared a place for us. Jesus Jesus was a conqueror. He went in."
" Conquer that. So now that you and I are ears to what he has done, was anybody feeling me what he has done? We don't have to fight, we don't that struggle as like he did. We may have to go through some things for the sake of Christ. We may get discouraged sometimes, but we won't have to battle and struggle for eternal life because he has already won the victory. So if he is the Conqueror, we are more oh great."
" God Almighty more than conquerors give me some word on that. Pastor. Well, Romans 8:14 through 17. You have it. This is for all who are led by the spirit of God are sons of God. You have received the spirit of adoption as Sons by whom we cry. Abba Father, do that means daddy. Daddy if we translated the spirit himself, Bears witness to our spirit that we are little children."
" Tune of God. And if there's then Heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, with the promise provided that we suffer with them, in order that we may be glorified with him. Amen. And it's, so this work tells me that when we come to God, as children of God, believing in, Jesus Christ. God is the father, Jesus is the Conqueror. We receive adoption."
" Ian into Jesus inheritance, when we come into his kingdom, huh? Romans 8:17 says, we are co-heirs with Jesus. So, whatever, Jesus has whatever Jesus is privileged true. We are, in fact privilege to the same thing. What he did on the cross, we may not have to suffer like you did, we will have to suffer some things. But but, but we may have to face illness some weed. Some people have to face"
" Have any some people have to go through just some hardships, but none of these hardships are permanent. They are all temporary."
" First Corinthians 15 and 50 says, I tell you this Brothers, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable imperishable. So what does that mean? Pastor. That means that you and I are heirs joint is, we have an inheritance and the spirit of God testifies to this, it seals the deals that no matter what we may say."
 We will come out on the other side more than a conqueror because Jesus is already conquered it for its y'all. So we are more than conquerors. We are victorious because Jesus conquered the power of death and the resurrection death and suffering. No longer have a permanent hole over Anyone who puts their faith in Jesus the Christ. So is anybody glad now like I said y'all
" This verse can help us in difficult times because look at this guy. Everybody everywhere is followed, is called a follow God, but not, everyone will follow the call. We all are going to have different tasks different burdens to Bear. Different challenges to face. John told Peter he said don't worry about what would their weight at that? That that that they're John walked here."
" God has a different path for all of us so I wanted to let you know that we are all more than conquerors in the trials and struggles that we Face. Yes they're going to come yes they're going to happen so no matter what difficulties coming like remember y'all we are more than conquerors. No matter how painful life can get, there is an end to that pain."
" And there is a glory waiting ahead. Well, I wish somebody would get that in your heart right now. No matter how much the pain is how difficult to burden. The struggle is, there is an end to it, it is temporary, but the glory that God has waiting for us will never ever go away as we go from day to day, as we look ahead and try to keep our heads up."
" And not be distracted. By all the things, the enemy has to throw at us. Y'all understand that we have an assurance from the word of God. And as Believers in Jesus, we need to cling to his promises. So, and then not only that, do we have his word, but y'all we have the indwelling, Holy Spirit, whom we can ask for help. We can ask the spirit for help too."
" Strengthen us through trials and tribulation. I know we pray to God. I know he's a God, but the proper thing to really say is, Holy Spirit help me through these trials and tribulation because Jesus I left him there to be your help and victory is ours so we can carry ourselves through this day. Carry ourselves through this week as more than conquerors through Jesus Christ because we have a relationship."
" Available. Everybody didn't have it. Some people want it but they don't have it. Yeah, thank you Lord. Yeah. Thank you know some yep I need I need about 12 more people to say Thank You Lord to tell God. Thank you. We are more than conquerors UK carry yourself with a swag carry yourself with your head held high, because you are more. Why? Cuz he is more. We are greater because not because of"
" Of us, but because he is greater greater, is he, that is in me than he, that is in in the world, huh? Thanks to God who has given us the victory through our Lord. Jesus Christ. First Corinthians 15:57 says, therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast immovable. Always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that your labor is not in vain."
" I want to encourage somebody that bless my soul to y'all. Jesus is already conquered because we are heirs with him, we are more than conquerors. And so our labor, your faith, what you Goin through? Can I share him? Can I tell you? It's not in vain hanging. There is going to be worth it. You might not be able to see it. Feel it since it right now. Seem like the world is getting over. They getting past us getting there."
" Ahead of us, but the Devil is a line that will come to an end and whatever you're going through a come to an end. But God for those who believe in Jesus have something greater waiting for us. Hang on to that. Y'all hold. I know it don't seem like much at time. When you're going through, when you're hurting, when you're painting, it don't seem like much but y'all it can be a difference between getting through and getting stuck. Oh, let me say it can be the difference."
" Is your belief in God, can be the difference between getting through and getting stuck. So don't get stuck. Hold your head up. No, then you are more than conquerors through Christ, Jesus. Who loved us? Amen. Yeah, amen! Amen, amen. That's right. Melissa. Hallelujah. I wish somebody two or three people in the time we got left. Come on. Let's just pray."
" Praise him. Just lift up some thanks to him some. Hallelujah. Is that what you're going? Through is only temporary but these glory is eternal. What you're dealing with is only for a time but the time will have with him will last forever and ever weeping, may endure for a night. But joy, if you believe Joy, if you're connected with him Joy, if you have a relationship with him,"
" Come in the morning. Amen! Somebody, amen. Amen, y'all, yes, yes, yes, Hallelujah. Yeah, they me and Lisa. Amen. Amen, brother, amen. Amen, amen. Yes, Y'all. We are more than conquerors. Y'all, you know, somebody need a word like that. Today, be feel free when this is over just shared with them. Let them know that as Believers we got"
" Wonderful things for us, only if you believe that's right. And he said, you got to be a believer because the tough times will come. The struggles will happen. But if we believe hold on to God's word, use the Holy Spirit, then we can't get through, amen. Amen, amen. Let's pray Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this brief time. We've had to share your word, Lord. We pray for"
" those that are watching those are will watch that will all rekindle our faith and know that you've already paid the price. You've already won the battle. You've already conquered? So because we believe in you. We are more than conquerors through your blood that was shed on Calvary, through your Resurrection. We are more than conquerors. So Lord God we thank you right now. We bless you, we"

I believe is not in May no matter what it looks like, no matter what the world says that I believe in you, my faith in you will have will have a glorious outcome but we thank you, Lord. Then in the meantime you skilled still give us Victory even before we get there."
" Would you still give us victories here on Earth? Thank you, Father, God for the times that you brought us through.

 Ray's we we sing about Amazing Grace. How Sweet the Sound but with y'all. It. Do you read Evelyn's ever? Look at how amazing it is. Just a few pointers on on how things in it is God's grace is so important because it allows us gives us the chance and opportunity to walk in humility to walk in life. Not worried about seeing how we going to see.
" But we all have to worry about the consequences of sin. Y Pastor, because of God's grace. Can somebody just say grace? Don't sound good job, God's grace? That sounds even even better since he God's grace gives us hope that there's forgiveness and Redemption for our sins and every day is another opportunity for us to live in."
" God's grace. I got heated me this morning. See, I know how, you know, Pastor because I see yall this morning and the Bible says that his mercies are brand new. Every morning we got up in the morning going to slap you in the face."
 Geology. We got all different types of names for Grace with y'all. Grace is just Grace and we God keeps his just good dude. Is it about know what I'm talking about?
" Trip on your mysterious, watch this. Now if I was in the courtroom and I'm trying to make a case for Grace, on the other side, I wouldn't have Justice. Then they didn't even I would have have some other folks who speaking against me."
 Me because he Justice is what we should have. Is anybody here? But Grace is what God gives what God gives us. So watch this. Now this story will go with me now. Imagine you long somebody something of value to you. I mean that thing is your prize lawn mowers. You trying to do it don't you see the issue of nice car at you?

 Something think with me now something that you put a lot of value on and you'll only to your phone.
" And take jobs in your friend. He didn't tell you, he told it so much so that you can use it anymore. That's also, no, no, no. Watch this now, not now Justice said, that that. Okay, I forgive you the Chan of my thing after I, forgive you sincerely from my heart, okay? And, and you can buy me another one."
" That is Justice. That's just as with him. He must see, Marcy says, okay, I forgive you and you don't have to buy my not because of our friendship. Nana Grace is a little different. Y'all watch this now you don't know about God's grace. Now to Great says that I forgive you for tearing my thing. I forgive you, I love you. I still do."
" Do what I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm gonna buy you a new one, what you told up on mine and later on, we're going to the long hallways. And we want to realize that just celebrate the fact that I gave you this brand new thing. Well, y'all think it would be young, that's what God does. What? We told him, our lives. We messed up my life and God said, I forgive you. I love you."
" Give you some most don't even know you miss. Nothing to do with what I gave you. Yeah, I ain't gotta do that. So that's the difference between Justice mercy and Grace, God gives us Grace. Is it buddy, glad that he didn't give us Justice."
" We've already read Ephesians 2:8 and 9 but let me, let me just this really give us a full back Grace. You have been saved through faith that not of yourselves. It is the gift of who y'all not of Works. Lest anyone should boast"
" What you say impassive Grace is a free gift who's it for its for Christians, who believe that is a part of the Salvation package. When we believe in Jesus grave, just comes along to see everybody. Glad about that passionate, fix it up. It's just a part of its active when you believe in Jesus Christ. So I want to tell you that grace and favor if you believe it."
" Are available to you and to me. So despite our age or I race or I socio-economic disposition, whatever it is. God's grace is available for me and you is it very glad about that. It was through the blood of Jesus."
" Most of the love the peace, The Joy, all of it came through the blood, somebody shot the blood. What Grace does y'all is, it gives us the opportunity to keep on keep on, keep on living and, you know, you got insurance right on your car and you don't have to worry about getting in an accident, right? Cuz you got insurance. Now, don't people who don't have insurance are looking around the corner."
" Why? Because they know if they have a wreck, they don't have any insurance. And a whole lot of trouble could have happened. Because of that, I'm not feeling here because it's the gift of God. We got that Assurance as ensures, that we don't have to worry about our lives. It's already taken care of. Are you glad about that?"
" Grace is like sunshine It Shines on everybody without discrimination. Are you? Glad that Grace is not for some boats and there were folks, can't get it seen. That's what it was like before they made it free everybody. Certain folks already been vaccinator all a long time ago why God are some money"
 But then the government made in free to who to everybody that's God's grace right there. You don't discriminate y'all. It is for me is for you. It's for the sinner. Is for the sake of God's grace is available when you and I believe in Jesus Christ and Grace can be applied to any situation. Or is it all y'all need to hear that. Anything you going through God's grace?
" It can be applied, we don't want to be shy. Come on. Good to know that, God, to pour out his grace on all of us at one time. Do you want to wait till you get through with your grace? Give me my grace. He can, he can give the whole world great at one time, y'all. That's some good news that God for Grace. Let's thank him for mercy."
" Seeing let's thank him for love. Let's thank him for Joy. Let's thank him for peace that! Daddy said, what passive all understanding? So, whatever you will not go through Grace good thinking case, I don't think so Grace is necessary. If I'm kidding with that, your street yet, here we go."
" How do you say? I'm not actually have seen all of us. See how it does need Grace because the Bible, lets me know, you you see, first John 1:8, if we say, we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in Us by the way. NLT says, if we claim to have no sin, we are fooling ourselves and we not living it."
" Truth or we got real quiet. That's why we need Grace because all of us have sinned and we'll see that liberates me and down for you. Yes. In is when you have a thought. So yeah. Don't don't know. Who are two ways that you shouldn't have? Yes, he is you say don't worry that you you should have let go a long time ago, where finger pop up and"
" it's in seeing we did think is what we do, but y'all sometimes seen in what we don't do is you made to God,"
 So what does that mean? We do it all the time. So that's why we need God's grace sometime. We do it while we sleep.
 Are you woke up? Use a lot of hope that any truth that we will do it in our sleep.
" God's grace is the extension for our safety. Come in our own strength. Y'all we came. I've got two or three Witnesses. If we're trying to do it ourselves apart from God, apart from the Holy Spirit, we can't do it. We're going to make mistakes. And they were going to notice long as we live, we going to be making mistakes against God. So we need"
" It's crazy not to shame. Can you get touched yourself and say I need his grace. Don't need it. Let me I looked up this poem by Janet milele and maybe this is you I it was me. She said, I know it's the spirit who is at work within me because I can't do anything about myself. I tried and I try but it's always the same. Oh, my own everything."
" You can miss. So I can praise to my Lord. I can praise to my king and I give glory and honor to God for it. Is him and not me Jesus. I clearly do see. It is his grace that enables me. Okay. Is that anybody in here, y'all know, has me on my own"
" God's grace reminds us that we do in fact,"
" Me God. When Pastor every day, every hour, no matter how many time lapse on, we mess up. God's grace, is there to cover us again? And again, and it can help us to overcome the worst nests of we've ever had. And I like, it's anybody ever been there?"
" But then y'all, God's grace is enough. What are you saying? Pastor, look at 2nd Corinthians."
" We notice is power talking about the other conversation with God as God to take that thing away and gods. And I ain't taking nothing away. Because I got it there for a reason. God of atoms are like, yeah, no. Please remove this. No, please get it. Up in the answer. Came back. I got it there for a reason."
" So what morning show was something? He told Paul he said my grace is sufficient for you, why? For my power is made perfect in what y'all and witness God's grace is sufficient. This verse tells us that it reaffirms us that God's grace can cover every area of Our Lives. What are you saying? Pastor? Can we be real for another moment? We don't like to give God here."
" Until we get away from control over here. We want to give got on the bed. Normally, I'm at each other like yeah, I'm a God normally I'm not, you know, I'm not gonna say I'm not no, no, no need you right now, it don't, we do that job. We, we compartmentalize God and it's only two, we really need him that will call her. And but can I tell somebody go?"
" God wants it all Grace colors. It comes in that in the Greek, that word."
" Cobblers means the cover like a teat then I know if we click here, we think alike you know just a little change. You by Walmart is a big circle steam gun just for one person. Does not want to cover everything, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly God says, I didn't order to receive my grace. I need to cover you like a chimp is everybody. Glad about there is not"
" Selective about what he will cover in your life. God says, I want to cover all of it, but you gotta give it to me. No longer we wait, the give them all. We got, we won't be covering job. That's why in our lies. I don't say y'all. Some stuff is blessed and some stuffing."
" Cover you like a circus team. Y'all know I will circles TV because everything comes at all. So God says I want to cover you but I need you to give me all of all of you and finally y'all, finally our Grace, not only enough but it is abundant down. We got to go home on this part right here. I'm glad that God don't run out of"
" Grace? I want anybody hear me? Are you glad that God's grace? Don't run out? The gravy has for you and for me he we can go to him again and again we can run to him again and again and the grace is still there, he doesn't give up."
" You know who didn't deserve no, you didn't deserve it but they were, was that grace of God, you know, you and steady. You're praying, nothing. Good. God grass, I'll be jumping"
 is still still available and God doesn't give Grace because he has to
" God, this is so wonderful. Not only does he want to give it to you in full measure, but when you get, he wants you to share it with somebody else."
" So when we give it to him God will make sure that you all right. Part of God great packages that he lets you know that no matter what it is, what you're going through is going to be"
 Long until you experience.
" Forgive me and forgive us. Our debts. As we forgive our debtors, just like we need a degree job. We need to be forgiving daily gear. We need to learn how to forgive other folks."
" People are leaving him big enough to tell you everything, right? Someone without forgiveness, give it one missing."
" See y'all. We need to learn as Christian how to forgive just like God has forgiven us. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
" God's grace is amazing. You can you describe how good God's grace is? And if you sit down and think about how many times God has shown you brace? Oh, great. God. By really all day. We wouldn't even have testimony service all the time that God is giving you."
" Grace, we would have time of the church as I remind you of how good God's grace is that we will not only receive it for ourselves. That we would not only walk in it and live in it, but there will be able to give it. Share it with somebody else. How many families are torn?"
 Parker folks won't forgive how many marriages have been thrown on the Rocks. Those somebody won't forgive how many churches have been torn apart and never going to come back together because somebody didn't forgive how you got to do it.
" It has some interest stupid, if you go back and check on it. If you ain't let it go, you still going to be there. Everybody hear me? So God is never to be remember anymore."
" As we going on. What are you reminds us? All of is that we're limited and God is Limitless. We are limited. But God is Limitless. So we learn how to forgive and we will learn how to watch this now, but humble folks. But y'all, we need to learn how to forgive us."
" And past mistakes. He doesn't need God in the rules against us. So, Jesus has already paid the price. You also can I ask you something?"
 What you waiting on people's to bless you?
" You bring it up Woulda Coulda Shoulda, don't leave no room for God. So now let's learn how to let go. And let God receive his grace in our lives. If you don't hear anything else. I say God's grace is a free gift."
 It doesn't have an expiration date. Fear 2020.
" He would have been. Okay, y'all his arms, you know, the DNA expiration date sooner, but I can claim God's grace, you can use it over and over and over again and it never runs out. What's his y'all? Last point, you don't have to give it back."
" And it is Limitless. It never runs out. Last point, is that we gotta God gives us his grace. We are learning your grace do."
" Everybody good news today. I just wanted to share that with you today encourage your heart. Remind you, whatever you're going through, or will go through God's grace, will cover up, just leaving. Thanks Chuckles chain. Now. He got enough Grace"
 You call me anything you and I will both go through little buddy. Glad about that.
" You gotta do this, that feels me. Did you ever see? Jesus Christ? There's a package that called grace, mercy and love. All of that is in the package but what is one of the you know, he wants us to receive receive what he has for us? Amen."
"when you start, when you start,"
Amen. Amen.
"One will keep it going and we look at some other verses as well. They share with us and show us that God is indeed our Strong Tower. Father we thank you so much, not just for life is well as it is no one understand and realize the Lord it could be a whole lot worse. Nora still hearing reports of sickness and illness and covid. Father God we're we're still"
" Dealing father, God with financial things, lots of job, and lots of Home Lord. With we know that you're still on the throne and father God, we come to worship you today. And Lord we worship through song and through prayer and US father. Now it is time for your word and I accept your word. Does what you said with you that it would defy those spirit and flesh or did it would deal with our hearts and our minds and that we could in fact reason with the truth this boy,"
" Another thing Ben said been done, Lord, when we need the truth. So we thank you for the truth of your word. Let it speak. Now to everyone's heart from the youngest to the oldest. Then we all may be blessed is in Jesus name, we pray. Amen. Amen and amen. Amen. This morning, we look at God as a strong tower. I keep versus Proverbs 18 and 10 and we read it again."
" Then in your hearing and is a verse of security. It says the name of the Lord is not see that. Now was not going to be, it is a strong tower the righteous run to it and are safe and y'all want to tell you this morning, very briefly that God's word, it's a refuge for you and I if you can't depend no nothing else, y'all, you?"
" Depend on God's words. My two or three Witnesses? Is that our trust in God's word and God's feeling like you said, wherever we might find ourselves. Whatever may happen in life that we have the security of God's word and God's word carries with it, God's name. So if you got that being you,"
" Going to be. All right. We gonna be all right, a strong tower. So first we got to know what the writer is talking about. You Solomon is speaking here and Solomon was King. So he knew something about hours?"
" Because they know original language is the Hebrews Psalm twenty and one tells us that our is a place that is to be defended. I was anybody with me here, it's to be sick, safely and secure on high. It leads to me too high for the enemy to catch you. It needs too strong for the enemy to break in on his body with me yet."
" And we emelye in a busy fighting will get you and I, everybody's intermittent on the aren't the same. It may take one form of an oar. Another one here we testified today that we all have enemies as we try to walk this walk and talk, this Christian stop, it is good to know that God provides his name that will fight against anything that the enemy"
" Strong Tower in means. And how you mean that is strong, but it also means that is elevated. Want anybody feeling here? I need somebody just to think spiritually. Women is strong if you can't get in and and is is elevated. Why is it elevated? Pastor. So if there's anything you can see what's coming before, it comes on TV. Everybody hear me today, said in my note"
" Oh God like that. As I helped you to see some stuff. That's always telling that God hears is a strong tower, took the y axis. Now in that Bible days, they use the towers for strength. They use the towers for defense and the Bible lets us know that they did in fact, ruin to the temple judges now,"
" 51 says, but there was a strong tower in the city and all the men and women, all the people of the city, fled their shut themselves in. And they went up to the top of the time. You'll see ya, they just go in the time with y'all. They went up to the top of the child. So what are you saying? Pastor, if we run to God,"
" No, just the one to it but we got one to him and run up so that we can be safe. That's the story told of an aviator back when they were first starting to fly airplanes and then doing fancy or anything, just just a fuselage and the wings, and the motor. So as this pilot started to go off in his airplane,"
 He heard it and he realized that there was a way is this place? And he knew that you can track your phone shooting he was going to mess up some wires and he was going to break something down and he couldn't fly savior or he couldn't land safely. So he realize that a rat yours a roommate.
" Rolling work more meant to be on the ground or underground. So he had an idea of people jobs and then if I go and I go and I go up a little higher, the rat is not designed to take that kind of pressure so he grew up and he flew up and he flew off my mother's house goes for and finally the knowledge stop. The rat was dead. So he started his"
" It back down. And when he got down to the ground, Faith, he pulls the red out in the wreck was dead. What are you telling me Pastor? I'm telling you that it's not enough for us just for run to the Lord but y'all we gotta go up in the law. What does that mean? We got to be dedicated to the Lord. We got to Worship the Lord because Jim ran into him and no you gotta get in there and see what God is all about. Do I have any Witnesses who have gone?"
" See you in my life, Gap in the rent and I life. And when we go a lot higher in the Lord O word of God, lord I feel God. Do I have some things of God got to die so he said that it is"
" God is like a strong tower. So but whatever. Show you this. You got 1811 to because the first part is good but if it's in contrast to verse number 11, so verse 10 says, the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and I say, but look at first you left. It says a rich man's wealth. Is he Strong City and like a hot wall."
" Hole in his imagination. What do you see their Pastor? Well in face Chan, I see go righteous. They run to the Lord and they are elevated. But both rich man places his trust in his wealth and Vernon. Laughs Oliver says, is only in his imagination. Is only in his head. He will last forever but it's only in his head."
" But the righteous we can be certain, we can't be sure that the word of God will last and last and last is anybody feeling me hear the word of God will not change? It's not just in my imagination. The word of God is good for mind body and soul. So he says in verse 10, the name of the lord, it's just like a strong team."
" Security is found in his name. Joy is found in his name and when we trust him we get the benefit out of everything that is with his name's. Ian shot name. He is, his name is, his name is in God's name reveals who God is. And again, I tell you like I told you before that, God's name is"
" Oh, wonderful. It means so much that we can't just have one word to describe how good I will God. So first of all, he is Jolly job. If you look in Genesis 22, 14, you discover that when Abraham was about to kill his son, the he looked around and the lord gave them a ram. Instead, the Bible says, they named that place Jehovah."
" Jireh, the Lord will provide. What are you saying? Pastor God is got wherever you need it, whatever fortune that you needed. And you, I have two of these weaknesses that he is and hometown of God. And my God, shall supply, all your need, according to his riches, in Glory by Christ Jesus. So, when you're in need of healing,"
" This word tells me that God has got everything you need. Not just physical healing, mental healing, emotional healing with you and I learn how to trust in God. Oh, we might have to take the medicine. We're going over Coliseum."
 Nothing.
" Really Kate comfort. You like the peace that God use Philippians 4:7 says of peace, that passes all understanding here. Who is that? That is Jehovah Shalom. So God Is Yet those come with, do it, whatever we need, where is it? Found Pastor is found in his name. Oh, did it by the witness over his name. So what does that mean?"
 It is faster. We'll check this out because God is merciful and forgiving then we don't have to suffer the punishment of the second death is anybody. Glad about that? Because we know that this world is not everything there is glad about that.
" His name is a strong tower will realize that God is slow to anger and that's in that you did. Don't have to be decision that you died with Jose Tabata. Glad about that because God is about his Everlasting Love, he's like a tower that we can learn to even with nobody else will love us. God will still love us his name."
" How would you work? Do we apply this strong tower to our lives? Well, I'm glad to ask. Well, if we just use his name alone, that should be enough for us to get through, but just in case is not. Can I remind you that Jesus is our strong tire?"
" I'll Man from Nazareth hung up. Your God does heal, took your sins and my sins? No Bible tells me that by his stripes. We are healed."
" Confess with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart, that God raised him from the dead. You will be saved. So how do I get this?"
" Be blessed. Come we want to go with God. We talked before you my friend India when God will show up like you wanted to show her it's because he's just, you're funny. God also, computer relationship. God, God don't want to be your friend."
" For free, God will see how God's going to be in love with you. He wants you to be in love with him too. Oh, yeah. And you you're thinking that you all in love but when they get out in public they say,"
" Oh, Jackie, that's just my friend. Think about how you will feel, huh? Y'all think about how you will feel. That's how we do, we do god, like that job."
 A little better. So how do we get?
" No, for you. Think that's what God wants us to do. When we run up, we find out some Joy. Then when we run up, we find that there's some luggage that we didn't see before and because wherever being in higher, God can show us what we need to see. Also think about here today. So back to what are you telling me? Well but there are provided"
" Listen to the Amplified version. It says, the name of the Lord is a strong tower. Watch this now, not the righteous man, but the consistently righteous man, who invented look right in his standing with God, runs into it and you're safe and high above all evil and he's still strong. What are you telling me? Pastor will see some folks will tell you that"
 You always win to God. That must mean that you running from the devil. Oh yeah.
 No way in God's word. Does it tell us the one from Evil to run from the evil one but it does tell us to run to God. My father tells me what we did that from Pastor Psalm 46 and one says God is our refuge and strength. Psalm 32 tells me that he is our hiding place. I said 25 and 4 tells me that he's a shelter in the time of storm. So it doesn't mean I'm running from
 The Devil Within me that I'm running to God because I know what God can do. I see it for myself? Nobody ever tell me I know God love you don't Strong Tower for me. So I don't care about you because he is everything that you and I need. Is that a good way to look at it?
" Because he people who won't come to church or people, who believe they say. All they know we're running. True to God, can I tell you and we learned a day, if we use God and his name as a strong time,"
" Oh, just some good news. God is always with him."
" Because we going, oh yeah."
 To Google what you need from you today. Don't just go me been dealing with for a long time. You why don't you and the Lord with me? Am I talking to anybody? Do you talk about?
" When you get up some things will follow you. Go up something, go."
 So much with his word. We thank you Lord that your word is
" Is is true. You love your children. You you say you're gonna be there for as you'll be there Witnesses and you promised to protect us, the leaders. The guy I was with Lord help us to know that in your is another level. If, and when we decide to go on that, you got some, some waiting for us. You got to answer to some of our questions waiting. You got feel some peace and we've been struggling to find. You got some Joy, when we been"
" Trying to find happiness. You got some some so you you erasing the past where we were holding on if we decide to go up. So thank you. Lord, thank you. That is not dependent on the church."
 Somebody's family that you would take them higher in your face. So right now Lord God we thank you that we first of all have made the choice to run in Jesus. Oh he got him.
" Is there what we going to hide? So, we thank you for sparing us. Thank you for grace and mercy for keeping us who we know that we can go a little high. So Lord, we bless you. We don't feel blessed, praise reports, and healing reports as we go higher as we kill something, we let himself fall off it because he can go with us. So we thank you right now. Jesus name"
 Right now church and those that they walk too.

Some of Faith because this book is so small. It is insignificant that do not add any value because people often time measure, significance and value."

The first thing I want to drop your spirit, this morning is don't you dare measure your value or your significance on the number of things you have done and the number of people who know your name is Laura God."
" They're getting business owners are pastors, Hunter, renewed Visionaries, don't you measure your dad, you on the amount, they need your help, and how many people know your name? Never say it again.

 It is worth something that is useful. And this book is needed every word. Although there are not many him that is flow from the pages of the book of Judith is significant. It has value of and it is needed. Can I call real quick like and talk to a group of people who are under the sound of my voice right now and tell you I don't care how small you look to others.

" He has value, although he did not even though he was not one of them. Let's look at Jude. Who is this man named Jude Jude name watch? This really means Judas, his name was really Judas, but to avoid connection with Judas. I calibrate the infamous man who betrayed Jesus, most English,"
 Translators have used the names you. They're about to say junior.
" Jude was the brother of Jesus himself. Judah was his brother Chu, like the other hand Brothers of Jesus?

The author of the book of Hebrews watch Now, does not identify himself, many believed it to be the Apostle Paul and have often arguments in his favor. You get it seems unlikely when you consider the offer statement in Hebrews 2 and 3 which says was confirmed To Us by those."
" Hurt him, this suggests the author, received the Gospel Mission secondhand why Paul declared that he had not received the gospel from or through men.

 Chapter 1 in 4 cities. Christ is better than the Angels Hebrews 7 and 22 says Jesus had become a surety of a better Covenant Hebrews. 1719 sees we enjoy the bringing in of a better hope Hebrews 86 is he is also the mediator of a better Covenant which was established on better promises my God. Now huh this signifies to me that the auto want us to know
" That Christ is better. He's better. He's better than anything. He wants us to understand in the book of Hebrews that Christ is better.

Just as we we have here at the beginning of chapter number 5, we see that a human high priest, must be able to emphasize with the people and all that to offer a sacrifice for their scenes only because Jesus was fully. Human was able to fulfill this role. The early part of chapter number 5. Once again, refers"
" The Psalms chapter number 2 and, and songs. 110 the point made here if that Christ was called to his position of a high priest, by God, now, stay with me. He was called to position of a high priest by God. This is what the Hebrew writer is trying to explain to the Jewish Christians. He's trying to tell them that Christ position as a high priest by God even managed to get good job. The Old Testament verses are explained as a prophecy about the Messiah."
" Messiah being both. Watch this being both about saying, both a priest and a king, something that was not the case. In the days of Moses, David, or Solomon.

Using the example of midship milchester date on the other hand."

" The business of me growing, he's in the business of me growing. Yes, I talked about in your physical of stature. I'm talking about in your spirit man. He's in this business of us growing. He wants us to be spiritual mature. That's why Saints have been in church, but 20 years of Quinn church now because they have not grown. They have not been there, not spiritual material. That's why people who you thought was strong in the faith. Don't come to Christ, don't go to church, don't pray."
" Faith. Because they really have not grown the since their salvation. They just been going to church, just knowing god. And before, y'all want to blame a church, I got scripture to back me up is not the church, is not the word being preached about the work that's being taught. But the scriptures go show us what the problem is. I'ma show you. Uh-huh, they could not watch this. He wants me scripture, they couldn't not understand who God how could Jesus be their King and their high priest."
" How can Jesus be their King? How could you be the kingdom and their high priest? And the author was trying to get them to grasp that? This is something that they should already have some understanding about? Yes, Lord God not so much, so that Jesus could be a king and a high priest, but Jesus had the power to be whatever he needed to be. They could not grasp, not just, he was just King The King and a high priest."
" But he won't them to grasp the idea of the power and the superiority of Jesus Christ. Yes, Lord. God that he can be what ever he needed to be. Yes, Lord, God. He was trying to get them to see. Jesus superiority, their growth was stunted because they could not fully understandable. Who Christ was many of us suggest that these Jewish Christians Christians, right now, we are not growing because we don't understand Christ."
" Superiority. We do not fully understand who he really is. Yes. Lord God, these Jews could not see Christ, being a king or priest, but they could not stay. I'm sorry, these Jews Christians could see Christ as being a the king or a priest, but they could not see him, being both, which in essence, hindered them from growing. Because in order for them to grow to be what God"
" Great them to be, they needed him to be their King and they need him to be their high priest Lord. God, some of us are in a Time, Warp in the spirit because we only see Christ to be one thing for us. I know we say he is the more but I actions prove otherwise. But today, the Lord wants us to grow everybody. Shout Road. I see y'all serious around. I see you, I see you still, I see y'all after you Shonda, he wants us to grow. Yes, Lord God, he wants us."
" To grow. He can be your provider, your peace and your protector, all at the same time, he can be your Comforts, your Creator and your Christ all at the same time he can be what you need him to be when you need him to be and he said I am that. I am yes. Lord God have your beef, whatever you need him to be, they could not see because of their lack of growth. The growth, the totality of Christ Jesus. Look at what the text says. Look at what the"

Look what it says in verse number 11, he says of whom we have much more to say and hand and, and it's hard to explain. She says, you have become dull in your hearing, never read again of whom we have much to say, and it's hard to explain since you have become dull in your hearing. Yes, Lord, God. The writer was saying, I want to tell you more about this."
" Supernatural superiority of Christ Jesus but I can't because you're a dull in your hearing. Yes. Lord God, the preaching. One, do the teacher one dog. He says, you're a dull in your hearing.

" Explain since you are become dull and sluggish in your spiritual hearing and disinclined to listen, you don't even want to hear what the word of God is saying. The writer was saying, you were rather stay right where you are instead of finding out more about the Supreme supreme power of Jesus Christ, instead of finding out, he can be whatever you need him to be yourself."
" But with him just being one thing, you satisfied with him being in the Box, just terrified with where you are in Christ Jesus. The rata wanted them to know because he wanted them to understand. That Christ is bigger, oh, Lord, God, and stronger than anything that you're going to have to go through to the writer had a vivid picture in a vivid vision of what the church was going to have to go through in the coming of time that they were going to have to face trial. They were going to have to face tribulation that for"
" Folks were going to die that folks. We're going to have to lose their lives and they're gonna have to be torturing and thrown in jail. He saw the picture of what the church was getting ready to go through, but he want them to understand the power, and the supreme power of Jesus Christ that he is bigger, and stronger than anything that they were getting ready to go through. And I came to tell somebody today, that Christ is bigger and stronger than anything that you're going to face."
" Life just or got. He's bigger, he's stronger. Thank you, Crystal, he's bigger and stronger than anything. You're going to face in your life, marriage problems. He's bigger and stronger financial problems. He's bigger and stronger that saying that, you think you cannot stop. The devil is a liar, christ--the is bigger and stronger than anything. You're going to face in life. He wanted them to understand how big and powerful Christ woes. Yeah, he wanted them to understand."
" And that was Christ that with Christ. Nothing shall be impossible for them. He wanted them to understand that with Christ, no weapon, that is formed against them shall behave. I see you dirty to prosper. Yes. Lord. He want them to understand that Christ what's their high priest and their King. What don't y'all miss this? He said he want them to understand and try to teach them. That Christ was the real milchester. Think he was the high priest and the King. Why is that important injured?"
" That important in it, he was their high priest and their King. They could not grasp Christ being the kingdom and the high priest. At the same time they figured he had to be one or the other but he could not be both. Yes. Lord God. They can understand the deity and the power of Christ. Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. He was there high priests and their King. Watch this the one them meaning Christ as the high priest in her seat and go to God on."
" Their behalf. And because he was the king because he was the king him going to God was him going to him to himself on their behalf. Meaning he has the power to heal and forgive he has the power to get you out and get you delivered. She has Lord God. They could not see it because of their spiritual immaturity and that's why many of us are stuck. We know God can get us out, but we don't believe that God continue. So we believe that God"
" Killed us but we don't believe that God can't deliver us but God can heal, and he can't forgive all at the same time. He can get you out and get you believe. With all at the same time, they could not see it because of their spiritual immaturity. Not only that, but there was satisfied, they were okay with not growing. There are some folks who are listening to me right now, who don't even know it who don't even know it, but they're satisfied with my"

I'm about through to show you. If your hearing has gotten door, if you're trying to read your word, read the word of God and it's getting boring to you and you keep falling asleep. While you read your hearing has gotten done, I know some folks would disagree because"
" It's boring, just reading, the Bible is boring, just reading the Bible, but the Bible says, the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged for the word of God got power. When not loses power of the word of God will stand forever. The word does not change. The problem is not the word. The problem is. How are you receiving the word of God? Yes, Lord, I am. It's not a problem."
" Mm with what God is saying. The problem is, how are you hearing it? And how is it coming until your hearing? Yes, Lord God, when you are hearing the word of God is not Dull. As a matter of fact, when you hear the word of God, it's not Dull. You receive the word of God with gladness and you see growth. Yes, no doubt he said, when it talks about the parable of the seed,"
" Just say it. When the seas are thrown on good ground is like the word falling on that they receive is like somebody receiving the word of God with gladness and you see evidence of something growing because they receive the word of God with gladness. Yes nor God. Look at the rubric. The rider throws out in verse. Number 12, we can recruit the right throws out a verse number 12. Look at what he says in verse number 12, I'm about to real promise"
" Uh-huh. He says for though, by this time by, by this time, by this time, by this time y'all been going to church mean hearing the word of God. You can talk to me hearing what's been going on? You seen Jesus hanging on a cross, you seen them laid him in a tomb. You seen him get up with all power in his hand. You see him raised Lazarus from the dead. You see him feed 5,000, people to the fish, five loaves of bread. You seen his power and authority, how he healed a man and forgave him. Yes, Lord God, everyone time. You seen how he healed the woman that was stooped over."
" If that the sanctuary and he told us that up, he healed her right in the sanctuary. You seen him the power of Jesus Christ, you heard how he taught the power and authority, that came from his lips. So by this time verse number 12 and Hebrews, you ought to be teachers. Hmm. You but instead, you need someone to teach you again, the first principles of the Oracles of God and you have come to me milk and not solid food. Lord God help me Jesus. Yeah, yes, Lord."
" He was saying when you should be telling somebody about the goodness of Jesus, someone still had to come and tell you about the goodness of Jesus, because you're still stuck in a Time. Warp your growth has been studied, because you are, what I say is, you're using the word is going to your ear, but you're not allowing it to be made manifest in your life."
" You're spiritually in mature. So when you should be teaching about this, you have need for teaching, you're going to Jesus said, go ye into all the world preach to together. Baptized in the name of the father, Son and Holy Ghost. The church job until the church. Y'all don't touch her job. And her job is to make disciples. As we make disciples, what you learn is your job to go out and tell somebody else what you learned. And now they can come and they can learn more and now they can go out and give others and tell them about what they learned and it."
" Revolving door compete coming in, coming, in coming and the church continues to expand, but the church can grow is because we have too many people still in the crib. So now those who really need them, you can't get the milk because we who should be eating meat or eating what the baby she'll be eating. We're not growing because I hearing has gotten do. Yes, Lord, God, we don't want to hear about what we don't want to grow. We want to stay."
" Stay in the same shape that we're in but today the Lord is telling us that it's time for us to grow. Watch this, watch this when when crystal ball, when he was a baby he was first born. Can you imagine this key? Imagine Cory. How much gold is Cory? Cory 7 and Christopher a baby, a newborn baby. Can you imagine when Christopher need milk?"
" Core drunk, it all up. He is taking all his baby food now. Christopher cannot grow properly, because someone who should be eating something else is eating what the baby still with, what the baby needs after you Tanya, can you imagine that that that he needs to milk?

He needs everything that he needs, someone that should be help taking care of him. Can't even do it because now they're taking up the space.

The epistle we call, Hebrews is quite profound and prolific all those I told you on last week there are something based on zero."
" Mostly a larger degree that that Apollo's is in our likelihood wrote the book, opposed to Paul, you will hear Paul talked about Apollo in the book of Corinthians when he talks to the church at Corinth because Apollo had Faith through Korean watch this now. And when Paul got back to Corinth that is all they were talking about, they were talking about Apollo all have with the Corinth preachers preach, the start of the church after he left Apollo Kaymer to correct and"
" Reach under the fire of the Holy Ghost and that he left and Paul came back. All prick was talking about was this man named Apollo and he had to kind of be at the kind of to defend himself. He said I came to you. I came not to you with sweating words or ex-exactly ethics excellently. See a speech. But a Pharisee of the spirit. What does it matter? Some say of you Apollo's and some say, you have a ball, you're one man plant. Another man, water it."
" God gives the increase as I listen to the dialogue to Paul to the Corinthian Church is sound like Paul was a little intimidating. If you read over in Acts chapter number 18 or 19, you will find wallows were described as being fervent in the scriptures and mighty in the spirit and the Bible declares him as this profile and prolific Verizon. And I believe that that's a slit. A true of the text in which we're going to talk about today. Well, God is the"
" Ultimate author, the right expresses himself in different styles. So from chapter that, shout there from book to book for Revelations, from Genesis to Revelation to Revelations, you will see stylistic differences in the house of the scriptures are made, but God is the ultimate honor. There is a difference, watch this and being after the author and being the right shoe, the author has the missions. And the writer writes them is that does not matter right there in the author had the face but the"
" Watch the Miss, there is a difference between those two things. So this book is offered by God but it's written by various people. So it's important that you understand that to appreciate the demographics of to appreciate the demography of The Taste. The second thing I want to say to these four preliminary, before we get into the text, the very name of the book is self. Suggest something that we must discuss a little bit. The fact that the book"
" It is called Hebrews points to the fact that God is Not colorblind. He is not oblivious to the culture. The fact that the Bible takes the time to address Christ through different cultural, who cut cultural suggest that God is not ashamed. And not a saint of are diversities. He celebrates adversities and yet calls us into Unity. It's possible to be proud of what you are and still be able to"
" It was somebody who is quite different than you that is some of the power of love and the Mystery of our faith and the Mystery of the human experience that we have many diverse. We are many, we are varied and diverse but yet still God wants us to operate in unity. Let the church say Unity. Now Duty I will admit it's hard to achieve and the enemy does all he can to fight against Unity because whatever God sees Unity he dwells in them."
" Miss of unity is Yahoo in our Unity. Whether it's 2,000 of us, $200 or two of us heat the whale to any Unity. He said what? Two or three are gathered together in my name. I will be in the mission and if they are Pentecost could not occur until they were in one place on wonder core because God loves Unity. Come on shouting. Hey y'all - Ali Unity you're typing on the screen."
" Going to a homemade Unity. If you want to look over your life, the thing that the internet has most open-minded, fix you in your life is Unity, whether it is in your house, what is it? You're choosing whether it's with your stomach, the enemy hates Unity, because God loves Unity. He knows that we watch this. Now, he knows any of that we touch and agree to Yellow something happens. He knows her they is jokes are broken. He knows change them all down. You know, cancer? Sweetie, no,"
" Who will disappear no Disease, by help me know, but he's come out of your body, whatever, we connect something up, that's why he might surface. Now just to do what we unify, you no longer living together. That's why we all get out who's things where we were."
 Who would exhaust the best because the devil want to call the vision in the house of God because he knows if we get together.
" Maya told my definition of Kamal, insert the disc New Life."
" Yes. Lord God well Jesus. Pray that we might be one even as him. And the father were also one. He is, was not afraid to be distinct in of of himself. He and the father watching out our one about him, and yet, there are things that can be said about Jesus, that could not be said about the father that although they're the same person, Jesus was distinct in himself."
" For example, Jesus died."
" For example, Jesus was born. Was that what? Jesus wept. So Jesus is not afraid to be one but still unique in his own to be one of the following must be unique in his own person. That's the mystery of the power of who God is he thought it not robbery to be equal to God and get made himself of no reputation. That is what the writer was trying to teach the Hebrews. He want them to get the Revelation that Christ could be more than just one thing."
" He was not her Steve, she was not worse. Your watch is diversity. Yeah, it was interesting to understand that God correctly. That's a lot of your he go, right to the people who live in Thessalonians. So I'd like you to have a special understanding of the word that is curved and community of their understanding, his metaphors with different disabilities with different the comparisons of difference. So they would be more Adept to the culture because so strong that he can speak."
" The same truth in different languages, not only can God speak in your country or language he can speak to anything, he wants to speak to. That was some of the right there. He can speak to anything. He wants to speak through to nothing at all. The limit is nothing is too far. Nothing has you crazy. He can speak to our couch and I'm not enough. We're here. Never have to move and speak to the queen and the reading of the word."
" Are you going to wait? He's a football around. He can speak to the role for all of the people speak on it. So life and don't speak Swahili, you know, how to speak to it."
 Pick one late.
" To wherever you are, my God."
 That's good news right there buddy. No one Lets Get News mother of all of them pick his relate to wherever you are.
" And that's why this book is called the book of Hebrews because he is speaking in the language, the people of Hebrew, the sick would understand, the book is preoccupied and causing those watch. This ebook is preoccupied and causing those who are stuck in a judaic tradition to better. Understand the true that revelation of who Jesus was they were stuck in a tradition that only saw Jesus one way. So the writer said let me show you who's Jesus"
" Revelation of who Jesus really is. And before you begin to look down on building the Hebrew, many of us are just like them, we see Jesus only in one way. So today, the Lord says, I want to give you a revelation of who I truly am, but what I Revelation you would not understand who Jesus. Is it is possible, but Jesus to be amongst you and if you don't have the right word revelation, you would not see that he is even there."
" So now he lived. Oh God, oh God."
" For now, he is Leah for 33 years. He's died on the whole Red Cross has been buried. And if my father grave, he has been hidden behind a stone. Stone. Had been rolled away. He is risen from the dead and Hebrews is written in retrospect explaining what has happened to the people in contemporary society and they might embrace the fact that the one that was hung on a tree, whose arms were stretched out, who's ahead."
" Head with whose head was late in the locks of his shoulder and Diner to their son refused the signs and the ground began to quake and tremble was the same Jesus. Somebody out here the same Jesus, the Same Jesus, that puts up a wedding turned water into wine, the same Jesus that took to fish those already paid the same Jesus."
" Mr. Porter. Because the Hebrews watch the, this is important because the Hebrews just saw him as one thing. But in essence, he was many. He was a Healer. Yes. Lord, he was a deliverer. He was a soul-saving. He was the son of God. He was God In the Flesh. He was a priest. He was Jesus."
 Now this leads us into understanding of the book of Hebrews and we come to wrestle with the fact that this particular writer is endowed with the power and the ability and the articulation of speech and the understanding of Truth to show those who were stuck in judea's Tradition tradition whom Jesus really is by using illustration connected to their culture is really is an Evangelistic book law God gives that later. So God
" I needed somebody to talk to the Hebrews. Y'all hear me. Unzoom you hear me, crystal! He needs somebody to talk to the Hebrews because salvation was to the Jews first, then to the Greek. God Now does not want anybody to perish. But everybody come to repentance and is laboring through the writings of Hebrews. So they can have a better understanding of who Christ truly is. So they can truly be saved by his blood."
 Good.
" Who starts the book of Hebrews chapter number one, version of one or two. We start by saying God who at sundry times and in divers matter speaks in time past unto the father's by the prophets. But in this last days spoken to us by his son is the same God, but spoke through different people. He spoke through the prophets in the Old Testament, but in these last days, he has"
" Spoken unto us by his sons and he bruised, being begins to correlate, what happens to Jesus through the things they could relate to. It talks about the levitical priesthood, it talks about Jesus being a priest. Like I told you last week, after the order of Melchizedek today, these people these were people that were familiar with things that they will understand that y'all with me. Now he didn't act the rabbit, not go over their head, he did not"
" It to be, he did not go to a place where the people could not understand. But he began to teach them in a language. And in a culture that they would understand, I can't go to the hood and talk about what was that. He said, have a new Tuesday, they will not understand it. I got the ginger level and teach them something and I know what they will understand."
" He spoke to them to write his biggest of them in a way. They would understand things that were familiar with. Yes, it starts part about him being both cruel or God knows what type of the most that I got myself. Happy I hear you saying that next. It starts by talking in the book of Hebrews bother about him being both the offering and the Opera Lord God."
" That he entered in. Once by himself with himself. Oh, what up himself to himself is a mystery but y'all catch the minute all the way up to Jesus. You were either the upper or other all Marine. The move. Could not be, though. It was all three."
" But Jesus. Well, Garfield is Bob Dylan y'all having distinction of being the first one to be both the other own and operate. No pre Jesus."
 He had an offering.
" To contaminate the sanctity of the offering Lord God. So that when you got, I'm sorry. So that when you got ready to plead the blood of Jesus over your children, it would have married her fingerprints on it. When you begin to think about of Jesus on all we do Batman."
" Jesus on all his Nation would not have married fingerprints on it. Yes, no God he was saying watch this to me. Oh Jesus. I don't want to catch what I already cured."
" So we're in the book of Hebrews, who God, he's I want to catch what I already cured. I went to the Cross to cure your backslide and spiritual, but if you text me, so bringing that back sighs. Don't test me is because I want you to I want to catch flowers here. Someone's like thank God."
" Fuck don't wants me to us today. So I texted a, the writer has an every other chapter leading up to now has led us down a road of legitimizing Christ, ethnicity. And of course, we're ethnicity a UTA Tian, TI, C, ity."
" But yeah, I'll tell you say anything."
" Look like Christ according to the traditions of the Hebrews of being eligible to be the sacrificial lamb, that the writer of Hebrews who some say is Apollo is now legitimizing Christ as the sacrificial lamb. Not only that"
" But to become also, our high priest. Now, they didn't have a problem here. Another problem with him being the high priest and then they didn't want him to be the sacrificial lamb. How can he man in flesh? Be the sacrificial lamb. It's not a writer. You're ready to explain them. Y'all missing out on something, Bridge had a priest right there. Bias if you missed out on something, when you don't accept Jesus Christ, as your personal savior, all of the gospels have proved. He is"
" Genealogy from whence he came which indicated the versatility that he was the Messiah. The one who was to come. And I said that right. Y'all here I say they're right, I did not sure it's crazy because I did not see him asked Messiah."
" We have come down to the 13th chapel. And then the riderhood Kathleen knows to us that Jesus died without the camp and we say it and I changed. It said, geez die, without the camera and I wanted to take the time for us to understand that Jesus did not do all that he did, so that he can stay in the camp. Wait a minute, Jesus didn't do all that. He can just stay in a building. He did everything that he can."
" So, he can get his name outside of the building."
" Because if we construct him in four walls, we have imprisoned him. It was never his will to be trapped in a building. We go get it in a minute. The reason why many of us keep doing the same thing over and over again? Mr. To Nia is because we have constricted God just to a building."
" That means we only feel him when we were in the building, we only do right? When we are in the building, we've only Praise Him in the building. He is too big to be held in what we built and it was. Now Amigas is something about to shake us from thinking about is all about a feeling he's trying to shake up as I go."
 I know the building I love in terms of I love those series of. Don't you kick me in the building?
 You got to do stopping after we leave the building to get his Iowa outside of the building.
 And yes.
 Surprise.
 We can guide our thoughts exactly outside of your way of doing things and watch the expand.
" The building works better with your own personal building your own, what you got going on in your own life. You see how expanding but you get me out your small bigger. Think I'm getting this new to God because you get there is little bit when I can do a whole life."
" We have the building for us. Not God, he'll need to build. He got somewhere to sit, he sits on the throne."
 Who is her?
" If you let him hear, show up Giggle forces, wait, but if you call Miriam mother show up, you're going to lose, right?"
" Problem, that we may God too small."
" If we lift them up like we supposed to I'm not through, I problems with shriek Jesus died outside the camp because the camp had too many restrictions lugod. He got outside of Camp. They haven't got the can't have too many restrictions. Can't have too many boundaries. That's why he said I'm going to hit on the side because the camp is too constricted. That's why I hate. Criminals didn't escalate this becomes a killer."
" The walls like religion but these were looking for relationship will need to make sure you want to pray out loud and run boats but relationship, make you go in your closet and bring religion makes you worry about whether people have our own relationships. Look at your heart. Religion goes by program but relationship, allow the spirit to have his way outside of account."
" That's what I thought the cuter because he sent their physiology, he said their Traditions, he said no idea."
" Hey, working great, Lucifer, son of the morning."
" Round showing the Hebrews, they have tuna walls as it pertains to Jesus. Many of us have got too many walls that Nick's as it pertained to Jesus to get rolling. Wait a minute not only did the writer speaking to the Hebrews of all he speaking to us right now."
" He's saying, we have too many walls as it pertained to Jesus. They saw him as a priest, but it could not see him after sacrifice. They, the one that they saw him at the priest, but it could not see him had to sacrifice many of us see him as a priest, but we don't see him as a sacrifice. What do you mean, Apostle making meaning we see him as someone who can forgive sins. But not someone who can wash away Isis."
 But we see him someone who can forgive our sins. I call him leave and I messed up but we will see
 bring him to me.
 It don't block the hard to see if it wasn't so serious away.
" If I would have put some years ago, if I would get a bottle and put and put everything I've done wrong and it's not a ball, went to the eye when our favorite play. The same distance to the beach, threw that ball in the beach. The waves are going to push that bottle. So I never saw him again. That means nothing in the bottle. I will be connected to ever again because it's"
 Gong his blood and just a forgiver but it's just like that when we let his blood washes I sensory it disconnects us from the sand.
" It washes as since won't know, God and Allah shall name him away. That means when I allow his blood to do this evolving and by his grace, his blood had the power and the ability to this connect me from back with your family, back in Washington, I believe. Now, step the Hebrews it just came up"
" Gordon. Now, they just didn't want to believe it because they didn't want their sins washed away. They just moved there. Seems like I have an open door to do whatever they want to do. What they want to do, I had it wonder whether you want to do that. They didn't want him to be their sacrifice. Look what it says in verse number 12, you say it down for Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood. I'm gone."
" That he might sanctify the people with his own blood, aren't you? Glad you don't you tell me what you did."
" It is the blood of Jesus, the blood of animals."
" But the blood of Jesus cleared the scene in other words around with the blood of Jesus, unlike animals does not wash those things away. But at a time,"
 It must be because he knows the blood of this. Will you marry me?
 This is me.
 There was nothing that was stuck in a Time. Warp. It was stuck in a Time. Warp they were stuck.
 Want to hold on to old traditions. That had no power. That could not free. You could not save. You could not cleanse. You could not get you out.
" But Jesus said I Sanctified with my blood that doesn't do it. He sanctifies us called us out says apart to be used by him. See the blood is more than just forgiveness of sin. It sets you apart to be used by God if it be so simple as giving somebody at home, that's going through a bad day."
 He said to a popular person that time to hug his blood now is different rate from you to him. It's a super says about you told me all right.
" Forget that gives you the strength to help somebody come out of what they're in blood of Jesus big, another building. My blood is crying through the streets."
 Crying looking for somebody to clean.
" This is his blood. Y'all. I want to read verse 15 says he said because I sanctify. You mother washes need to do bird number 15. He's angrily, you're stuck. He says he had this plan to the Hebrews because evidently when whoever was writing this, I guess he felt. Yeah, yeah. Y'all need to be a little more scientific about this blood, look at what he says, he gives them instructions, perfectly says, therefore my him with us."
" Best I ever, preached, you ever passed every bishop ever in a sense of every, every praise and worship needed every every Deacon, every mother. Every remember, if you clean the bathroom, you, if you fought the cause I parking lot. If you don't pass a let us continually"
" Offer sacrifices watch this because he knows that you can't sacrifice well, he sacrifice. So I'm going to take a second Vice, what you can sacrifice continue to operate off of the sacrifices of Praise. That is what we say is celebrating God, that is the fruit of our lips, giving, praise"
" I'm sure I got let me say it again. He says, let us continually offer up sacrifice of praise. That is sprayed onto God, pray. He say unto God. We got to put that down, he said unto God, that is the offering from the fruit of our lips."
" The offering from the fruit of our lips. Giving, thanks unto God. Why? Because he has given me his blood, he is more than just a pre, she's more to just one that goes to the follow my behalf, he is the father. So he goes to himself on my behalf and he makes a decision about me according to him through his Bloods and because of he says let us continually offer up. Sacrifices, pray, that is unto God. That is"
" Fruit of our lips, giving praise unto our God. So now just lower whether your Zoom, I see, yall ICU for your resume, whether you on Facebook live, whether you in the sanctuary. Well, you looking at at this moment, let us offer a sacrifice for the workplace is all. Well, I wouldn't say I live right now. I want to hear your mouth right now."

 Someone who is not saved. It's good time to get a bunch of blood at this moment. You're not going to church and join the body.
" You're the body going to come from the body and I tell people all the time, don't worry about getting the best church pew, this body."
" And as you become the best body, part of the body, God to make us the best church not talk about as a whole, not my name, that's my asshole."
" Yes, Lord, if you're not saved, safe says to him. If you're not sure of that, you're not sure of that. Repeat this prayer with me. Father God, in the name of Jesus, forgive me of all my sins. Lord God, I confess you at the build of my life."
" Lord God, I believe in my heart and I confess with my mouth, the Lord Jesus."
 That God raised him from the dead.
" See if I believe that, no, God, I'm saved. I will not be like to use. Father God in this book of Hebrews. Father, God, in the hold you into a box in the one place. At the one thing I know you as my savior and I thank you know what you're saying in Jesus name, I pray, amen, you're saying, it doesn't stop there all the times. That's what. Mrs. Was up.

" Yes, we don't hold them in the four walls but he wants you to give it to the church. He made the church that we can strengthen. One another fellowship with one another"
" And if we go out and kill what we got in here. So if you don't belong to a church where they have your new life with love to happen, if you want to be a family, like this major International where love to have you. Thank you.

But listen, I'm asking that as a member for us to pray for that, for our leader, we are thankful for his job."
" I'm not asking you because folk get, they think you're begging for something. If you start asking them that way, we're just asking for the freedom and his schedule to be able to teach the class that he wants to teach and do all those things that he always plans to do and he can't sometimes do them and so I think that that's what we become active and what we do is we pray that he gets the opportunity to do these things.
