 slow it down a little bit this morning and we will see what the Lord's got for us in Genesis chapter 17
" He's good to us, amen."
" All the time from Genesis chapter 17, the book of the beginnings, how many of us know, sometimes we need to go back to the book of the beginnings and very familiar scripture. We all know the story of Abraham or Abram the Lord changes his name."
" Genesis 17 and beginning with verse 1 and when Abram was ninety and nine years old, he was pretty old when he was 99. How many of us believe that? Even if your 99? And God says that he's going to answer, he's going to answer and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto him, I am the almighty God walk. Before me and be ye perfect."
" And I will make my Covenant between me and you and will multiply you exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying, as, for me, behold my Covenant is with you and you shall be the father of many nations."
" I want to kind of build just a little bit of a background and chapter 12 of Genesis. The Bible says, this is the first time that God visits with Abraham brother. Mine and he tells him in chapter 12, which was around 25 years. Before chapter 17, he tells Abraham, I am going to make you a father of many nations, as we all know the story, he tells him that he's going to go out and number, if you can go out and over the Stars when you go out the number they're saying this is how much"
" Your your descendants are going to be. So you makes this first Covenant with Abraham in chapter 12, now fast forward. 25 years later as we all know the story that God made abrahamic Covenant and he made that Covenant that he would have a son with his wife. Sarah in this chapter 17 here. The next few verses I'm not going to read these because I have a couple other verses I believe I'll never get to this morning. He changes their name from"
" Abraham from Abram to Abraham. He changes his wife's name from Sarajevo Sarah, he changes their name. There's a name that I want to talk about this morning is, when he first spoke to Abraham and he said, I am the almighty God. How many of us know this morning we're serving the almighty God? He never changes. People change, people change as I demonstrated many times about as fast as you can up that are put that box which are but I'm glad God doesn't change a mean and the median"
" The first time that he spoke to Abraham and that he told him his name. He said, my name is almighty. God, y'all, we're serving and almighty God, washingtondc can't be thrown God. Nobody can Dethrone God. He said here, what is the interpretation of almighty? God is el-shaddai. How many of us know, we need to tell ourselves else should I? What does that word mean? Sister? Can you? That word means that we serve a god, that is sufficient, then whatever we need in our lives. Brother, might be sufficient."
" Center provided a man and not only is he efficient to provide it, but he's a good God. You were saying he'll meet every need that we've ever had, but we go in between. Look, let's look for just a minute because that's Pentecostal people. They don't take as you drop a handsome. Nice Don't Preach a man, but if we if we fast forward back and we look at these 25 years, there was a lot of things that Sarah and Abraham and his wife, Sarah, got it wrong. That man, there was a lot of things that they got sort of side."
" Over the promise of God, y'all, we need to hold true to God, but we've never have true to God what a world that tells us to put God to the side that God doesn't matter how many of you know, people to know who matters this morning. It's the Lord and Savior. Jesus Christ. He's the one who won't do for us in these 25 years. Imagine God speaking to you."
" Maybe it was about, I wrote it down so I wouldn't get confused. I believe he was about 85 and Sarah was about 75 when God first made them this promise and then they got tired of waiting church can I be honest with you this morning be careful about getting tired of waiting. Be very careful about getting tired of waiting on God don't get sidetracked and go off on your other plan about 13 years prior to chapter 17"
" We all know the story about getting it back and warn, you don't get caught up in chapter 16 of your life so to speak. Because if you read in chapter 16, his wife Sarah comes up with another plan. Don't try to come up with another plan, besides God's plan for your life, don't we move the ultimate plan of God for your life because in the plan of God in the church, and in my life,"
" Because I want to be the best of the best, because I'm not, because of anything that you can do her. I can do. But because when people look at us, they see the spirit of God owners say, man. But anyway, when they went in Chapter 16 years, Sarah begins to, I can imagine this cannot and woman all the man said, amen, I can imagine this woman going to him and said I'm just I don't know if it's ever going to be what God says. It's gonna be true."
" Can I tell you? It's gonna be what God says is going to be. Maybe if you're healed your Hume and goddesses you're gonna have a baby, you're going to have one. If that is, your finances are going to be better than they've ever been, you know, that it is, it's all about. He's gonna open a door for you, he's gonna open that door, I mean, unless you're listening to the devil, are you listening to her about profit? And I don't know of any false prophets in here this morning, I think. But Sarah begin to talk to her."
" I believe she said something like this. Well, you know, I just don't know that I ever being the way God says, it's gonna be and Abraham. I believe even told her. Oh my God, I want to watch that. So that's how many of, you know, when you hear from God, you know, you've heard from God, don't let people to turn you from. When you know you are from God, don't do it just don't. That's just for all of us. Don't do it when God speaks to you and then you know that this is the power of God. Don't let people deter you from from knowing that this"
 this is God's will for your life. For this is God's answer.
" Your promise is set to be delivered. A me how many of you know that delivery day came and they have some but before that they got themselves in a little bit of trouble, getting out of the will of God is consequences that you and I will pay for for many years."
" He had a son. He had a son named Ishmael with his handmaid Hagar and Ishmael and Isaac as we all know why they're still fighting and why they're still turmoil in the Middle East today because of one man. And one woman couldn't hold out for the promise of God church. I want to tell you, don't settle for anything less than the promise of God in your life. Anybody listening to me, don't settle for anything less than the promise of God and your God is going to deliver his promise and your buttocks."
" When we least expected he said here and we look on over into Genesis 18 and 14 and when we go over into so don't get caught up in chapter 16. Don't get caught up and in chapter 16 is when they kind of derailed off the promise of God, keep your mind in your eyes on the Target and that Target is the will of God. A man."
" In Genesis 18 and 14. He asked, Sarah. Will know the story. God comes to visit Abraham and he says, well let me let me fix you something to eat and I'm here to present all this and Trevor 18. He says I'm coming to visit. You and Sarah begins to laugh at dawn. I want to tell you something church. When God tells you he's about to deliver your promise. It'll make you laugh. Maybe some people said she might have been laughing, because it's not possible. I'm 89 years old. And my husband's about 99, it's not possible. But we don't know that maybe she was lacking from the joy."
 She asked a question. God asked her a question. Is there anything? That's too hard for God church. I want to ask you something this morning. Is there anything in your life? It's too hard for God. Is there anything that you need from God? That's too hard for God to do and then again Jeremiah 32 and 27. He asked the same question to my knowledge. This is the only two times in the Bible that this same question is asked is there anything? That's too.
" Hard for God. Some of you may be facing something this week. It may be an answer and maybe you might need direction. You might be going to a doctor's appointment. I don't know what your lives are everyday, but God is telling you this morning. There is nothing too hard for him to do when that are point in time. Came for God to show up and say, all right, now I'm ready to deliver my part that was nothing and think about this. There's nothing you can do. That's going to ultra God's promise in your life. You may make mistakes. You make it all track. You may do all these things but you can, you're going to women."
" The consequences for doing those things. But what's that / God is they're going to show up at your door and say, here I am, I've come to deliver how many people got to deliver the promises that he's promised you and your life? I mean, I say Brothers like that, man, I'll make you a promise before. The sun goes down, that works sometimes, don't mean anything, but aren't we? Glad that God's word means everything to us. Are we glad that when God is there an appointed time? Is there an appointed season?"
" No, yes, there is Amy and I'm going to show you that in just a minute. God make the promises. Do we often sometimes get off track on our own promises and when we do it delays God's plan. How many of you know that I believe that God's plan was delayed."
" the Bible says, if you read out the numbers that he waited about 25 years,"
" It doesn't matter. Miss Jamie, we have to wait a few years. How many of you know, God is going to deliver your palms up there? Come a time that Sarah and she was laughing at God and we can take it either way, you want to. And I believe Philip that is that as she began to, she got pregnant there and there's a she began to deliver. Isaac. I don't know about y'all but I'm not sure delivering person. Amen, but there's some things in our lives that God is going to deliver to you, amen. Yeah. Ordered a package online or whatever the case may be and there's a, there's a"
" Estimated delivery. And sometimes it gets there when it says it is and sometimes it gets there when it maybe a day or two earlier or maybe a day or two late, it's never just forgot y'all to tell you something. When God says the delivery time for your life and what he's going to do for you, it's not going to be two or three days early. It's not going to be five days. Weight is going to be some of us in the promises of God in our lives. It may take 25 years, but at the appointed time, God is going."
 In to deliver what he says he's going to deliver a man.
" And as we sang that song, the Holy Ghost in Acts, I want you to turn with me to the book of Acts."

" Of the promise in God, is saying to us. We make we, you know, we not, we don't may, we do live in a world where perilous times has hit the face of the Earth. The Lord warned us of those things. I believe in the book of Timothy that the perilous times we're going to come, you know, that evil was going to fix itself more and more as the day of the Lord approaches and all these things that were, then going to turn their backs on God and all these things were going to happen. How many of us know that we're in those times right now as far as in this world but in ours"
" As Philip said this morning, where is that same? Holy ghost live? He lives down inside of us and even in the book of Acts where the where the few few chapters before chapter 7, when they had the greatest Revival that they had ever had, I believe on the face of the earth and the Holy Ghost came down, and they began to speak in tongues and they begin to believe as they were in the upper room. And and in hundreds, got saved under the ministry of Peter and that won't shortly after that, the Lord wanted to go back and revisit something that he had told Abraham, brother, Frank here.

" You said at an appointed time, I'm going to deliver what? I promised you, if we look at this and we say that that same guy he lives down inside of us. He told Abraham. I am almighty God. He started the conversation out by letting Abraham know who he is.

And how many of you believe?"
" Because of almighty God no matter what y'all, we got years of promises that God is saying to us this morning that he's going to delivery."
" How many of us know this morning that by the grace of God, we can make it through anything in our lives. So sure. Candy you have no idea what I've been through y'all. We could all say that about each other and then I believe the church folks are the best ones. We make a profession out of putting on our face. Amen. Some of the most depressed People You Meet is church, folks. Amen. Because we know how to put our face."
" Let's start by chopping said God, I'm in the somewhere in the middle of that, 25, your promise. And God I'm somewhere in the middle and God my family still acting crazy and and got this is still going on and got. This is still going in alone. I'm almost sure.

And got our, we're not here, and I've done this. And I've got my life's short and a mess. How did you know that? God didn't care that they were him and got his life in a man."
" Is by getting another having a son with another woman, what God cared about? He said, Abraham my almighty God, here I am. I've come to do exactly what I said. I'm gonna do you know that God is going to do exactly what he says, he's not somewhere on the bench wondering whether or not, he would he's going to do or how he's gonna do it. He's an exact job. Sister Katie pretty good to me."
" Let your gaze beneath. Yeah, and your knees be naked. It's not somewhere wondering and thinking about what I'm gonna bless you Newport Worship Center. I'm not gonna bless their families. He's not somewhere wondering what he's going to do. He only knows what he's going to do and when he knows what he's going to do, there's an appointed time.

" It may seem like sister hanging out had, you know, he will get that one product when things don't happen when they think it should look, can we just be real for just a few more minutes? People get I have heard."
" Saved blood bolt, Spirit-filled gift field. People say well, I've had word spoken over me many times."
" The church is true. I've heard people say that I had words and stuff like that spoken over me so many times and people have gotten it wrong, y'all. Can I be honest with you man or woman may get it wrong but God Almighty never does say almighty god brother, Mike never gets it wrong church. I want to encourage you this morning that almighty god.

The more I pray the harder. It seems to give the more. I pray the worse, it gets the more. I pray the further. It seems like God's A Million Miles Away. Now we can open our eyes. Did you take a minute to reflect on yourself Church, the hardest person?"
" The world of be honest with is yourself, it's true. The hardest person in the world to be honest with is yourself. Don't be discouraged because God had answered when we think he should that just because he doesn't answer on our time. Frame does not mean he's not going to answer. Amen. El Shaddai, El Shaddai. I believe that God will visit us amen. He said I'm almighty God."
" He said, Abraham."
" I'm almighty God. I've come to let you know that what I told you 25 years ago still stands because I didn't change my mind. How many of us know that God's not going to change his mind when it comes to blessing us? He told Abraham, I said, I wouldn't make you a father of many nations and what I said is going to be people think in this world that God has been minimized to their standards. How many of us know that God is Not minimized to any of us? He's the same yesterday."
" Today and forever alien, and the Holy Ghost in Acts, he still the same, maybe he still the same, and I believe in the outpouring of the spirit of God, I believe that God that there's promises that God has made in our lives and we just got to say, God, I want them. They mean,"

This is the word for the day and God is going to have his way, amen. Mark chapter 5 and verse 25 and a certain woman who had an issue of blood twelve years. How many of, you know, that whatever our issue is"
" Watch. Got the answer, a million and had suffered many things of many Physicians. I would stop there. For just a minute. We're gonna break this down here for just a minute.

You know the one you go to this one for this and then they can't. Well they don't have the right opinion then they'll send you to the other one to see if he's got another opinion in."
" Then that going to send you to another one to see. If they've got another opinion, and don't get me wrong, I'm in the medical field. I understand how it works. But the Bible says here that she had suffered many things of many Physicians. Basically, she had when they had done all, they could do and they could not solve her issue in some of us here this morning, feel that way, how many of us feel like we've gone and we've done all we know to do and I've still I'm still faced with this thing that's in my life and had spent all that she had"
" She didn't spend all of our money, everything. How many of you go to the doctor and you feel like you've spent everything he got? I mean, if you if you suffered many things of many Physicians, by the time you get to the end, you you going to spend a whole lot of money and was nothing better but rather grew worse. In other words, she had done all she could do within her own power and nothing worth noting even got better, but were it just continued to grow worse."
" Did of going the other way. And when she had heard of Jesus, when she had heard of Jesus,"
 Came in the press behind and touched His Garment.
" for she said,"
" If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be made hold. And straightway the Fountain of her blood was dried up"
 And she felt in her body.
" That she was healed of that plague. And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press and said,"
" Who touched my clothes, and his disciples said unto him, you see the multitude pushing it? You, so, to speak and saying and now you're going to ask who touched me. I want to paraphrase here, just a little bit. Add my twist to it that I believe the disciples were looking at. Jesus sir. You have you y'all, right? There's no way we can tell who done this. One of the things I want to point out here is that she's the Bible says that she said if I made but Church to him"
" Of his corner. Now I wonder here. I've heard this message preached, many times I've preached it many times through the years. Wonder here's the Strand. Nobody knew who had when Jesus turned around and said who touched me virtues gone out of me, something's changed in my body. How many of you believe that? What came out of his body went into her body? Because he said, weren't you came out of my body? And then she knew within her body that she was healed. But nobody knew who this was. Nobody, can I do?"
" Identify the wait a minute, this is the woman. It was an honor. It was Jamie or was Gene or it was murder was sharing. Nobody could identify that this was this woman. Nobody heard her speak. So therefore she spoke within herself if I can but Touch the Hem of His Garment how many of us understand this morning? That sometimes we need to talk to ourselves. And say, if I can do this I asked about it by God's grace, I can do this. I mean, by the Lord's Grace, I can do this and what you do."
 Have to tell the devil watching see what God's gonna do baby. How many of you know that we need to curse them things in our lives?
" You can say sister Qing, is that what we need to do? I believe that when virtue came out of the Lord, and went into this woman that that blood issue that she had that physical ailment that she had for 12 years, was cursed from the route Breitling. How many of you know, that we need to curse things in our lives and tell the devil that thing is cursed. And it's not coming back on my body or it's not hunting back in my favorites, not coming back in my life anymore and walk away from. And how many of us have that kind of thing? This morning? I don't know about y'all but I"
" Kind of like this morning. I know back in May of last year that we wrote down, I asked everybody to write down things that they wanted to see God doing that. We would look back on it and a year and see what God had done sometime last year. I wrote down in that I said that my mama would never have them on you again. How many of you know that may seem crazy because of her agent because of her history but since last July, when I wrote that down, Mama hasn't had any more issues with that again. How many people"
" And I said, God it's been almost two years since she's had to be in the hospital for that. How many of, you know, that she's been having this sick of her stomach? Every morning, because of the medication she takes and I stop for a minute and I said, even if I'm late getting to church, we're going to repeat this thing. We're gonna crush this thing and I'll believe that when I left the house this morning, that it comes over every morning left. Amen."
" How many of us know that we put up? Then we need to tell the devil said, wait a minute devil. First this thing to the roots. God didn't just give me or preachers are some preachers. I want them animal who turns up a DUI, he just gives certain people. The ability to say to the devil get away from me. The Bible gives that the Lord gives that to all of us. We need to stand up and say, wait a minute dad. What if this lady here, had an issue, whatever my age,"
" A shoe is I can get to the Lord in The Lord of solve my issue. How many of us believe that this morning that we can speak to it? But as long as we don't speak to the Devil, he's going to continue to bother me. Amen. We need to show the devil until the devil. But with God, great things will happen in our lives. I mean, in Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone on him and turned him about in the press and said, who touched me and the"
" It was said unto him, you see the multitude and you're going to ask, what if it's tight was? I think they had to put a bit of an attitude. Can you read this and find out? This thing that they have a little bit of an attitude. Whoo. And you're going to ask who touched me and he looked around about to see her that had done this thing."
 I believe that when the Lord looked around he could he look right into her eyes and he me that she was the one that had touched him but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done to her came and fell down before him.
 And told him all the truth.
" and he said unto her daughter,"
 Your faith has made you whole go in peace.
 And behold of that leg.
" you know, the Bible says here, that in the first part of that, that I read to you, the Bible called it, that leg"
" In the first few verses of that, the Bible calls it that plague that she had. And then Jesus is it's written. In red told her said that point how many of, you know, there's a difference between that plague and you'll click and sometimes in life. We take on that leg when it's really not ours. Amen. And our plague, God has the answer for it and I want to read one more verse in Revelation."
 Chapter 12 and verse 11.
" And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. And they and they loved not their lives unto the death and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. Now, this woman here in Mark, I read to you. There's a different"
" There's different versions of it. I read it out of Mark. There's one out of Matthew because that's the four gospels. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. And I read Marx, Take On The woman there with the issue of blood. But it says here that they in Revelation that they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony, I believe this morning brother, Michael, we can overcome anything by the world of Alliance. Hey, man, how many of, you know, that blood has God's blood in the blood that he shed at Calvary?"
" Is got it. It's powerful and that he looks into our lives and he knows that, you know, no matter what we face, no matter what we have to go through, and we can face it by the blood of the lamb. And I believe that many of us as we many years ago, had that prophecy come out about the blood here in this church and we applied that blood to our own doorpost, so to speak in the spirit realm. How many of us know that the devil cannot cross the bloodline you? Some of you need to be reminded this morning is, I am often times in my life that the"
" Blood of God, still works. So him that you are covered by the blood of a doesn't matter. It doesn't matter where we are and we're both the promise. We're both the high price and it was the blood of the lamb and how many of you know that we're going to overcome all these things by the blood flowing."
" But as long as we got the blood of the Lamb of God are rods and all things are possible. How many of you this morning that said, sister candy. I feel like I'm just hanging by a thread I'm preaching to somebody because the Lord I didn't have to study. I didn't even have to ask for more. What do you want? You know, preachers has been preaching a long time. Lord, what do you want me to push or appreciation? I would reach that. But when there's a, there's a word. And then there's a prophetic word and sometimes when God gives you something to three days ahead of time, there's somebody in here to East, you know, you may be thinking about"
" The human mind about red, but sometimes all you need to do is Touch the Hem of His Garment. I mean and there's many times that we may have to go back and Touch the Hem of a garment one more time. But he's always there. He never leaves us, nor forsake us, and by the blood that he shed at Calvary, somebody in here for you, but God wants me to tell you this morning. They there still hope you hold on to that thread. Don't you? Let it go because by the blood of the Lamb, we are all Overcomers."
" Lord, if I do, but Touch the Hem of His Garment. What her issue was is a besides, our physical issue is that she had a crowd around her. There were things around our people were trying to get to Jesus. People were trying to get to him because they had needs in their lives, but now that is that he died on the cross and he rose again. And he went down to Hades and got the keys of death, hell and the grave. He overcame these things about his blood then when that said veil was rent from top to bottom and it"
 We have access. We don't I don't have to worry about you taking my voice. I don't have to work that somebody else ground around him. But what brown just around is the things in our lives.
" I'm in a different kind of crowd, it's not that that we physically have Jesus here with us in there. So many people, there's multitude surround that we can't get to him, but what he does, is he crowds online when maybe a telephone or maybe this or maybe that in our lives or maybe it's the job that crowd your mind. What is it? This morning that's crowd your mind away from the Lord. The Lord saying this morning. There's some of us are in the sense of the speed we're hanging down."
" Red. But one thing I know for sure is most suited than that, we can come as a storm. Says we met. We can climb a high mountain maybe even though it may look bad. Even though they may look this way in our lives, Miss Eddie used to sing the song. I'm climbing a mountain trying to get home. What happens to people when they quit climbing is that they backslide on God. I mean, we gotta, we gotta keep climbing saying God, no matter what I have to face God, no matter what I have to go through, God, you are the answer right now and the"
 The song says it's when you are hanging by a thread.
 You can climb.
" The highest mountain, though, the cliffs are rough and ragged you can code. If you slip and reach ropes in you will find the Hem of His Garment how many of us this morning, say sister candy."
 I'm hanging by a thread.
 So she can be. I feel like sometimes that I don't know if I'm going to make it or not.
" Sister candy. I feel like that something this week, slap me in the face, and I don't know if I have the answers or not, so she can t, I don't know if if God is going to answer the way I want him to or not such candy, I've been dealing with this physical element for a long time, and I've been praying for many times, and I just don't know if God's going to heal my body."
" Church. I want to tell you something this morning, God still in the miracle worker bees, they say all the time how many of you know, the church can warp your mind"
" Hey man. I remember that growing up that used to say, well until you get healed of being a diabetic, you can't break for anybody else. What foolishness Church, what foolishness, how many of you know, that I am your? Because you can look at me and not even tell there's anything wrong with me, but one day, I'm going to be healed over on the other side, completely. But we have to take that and we have to say, God y'all don't take no foolishness what people will tell you and one of your mind baby in because God is saying this morning that"
" We look at the scripture, we look at these things that greater things than what he did shall, we be able to do and he look and virtue came out of him. I believe the Lord saying virtue will come out of him, through the spirit realm this morning for somebody that would dare to Touch the Hem of His Garment. I did, do we need a touch from God? Give me come to church and you come to church this morning to get a touch from me. You come for the wrong reason. But if we come to get a touch from God, we come for the right reason."
" You got in store for me. God, but I'm fixing to go where I can reach the Hem of your garment ugly. That's what will see. Miracles back on the face of the Earth. How many of you know that we need miracles on the face of the Earth? Again, preachers. Don't want to preach about several things. Can I tell you what? They are first and foremost preachers in the Pulpit. Don't want to preach about Sleeman. He need the truth. Yes, because we live in a time where everybody's okay and everybody's going to heaven. How many of you know if I've got sand in my life? I'm not going."
" Only way I can keep saying out of my life is through the blood of Jesus. One of the other things that I want to preach about, is the nine gifts of God, and of the truth, and we were preaching about it. Administrator under the anointing of the nine gifts of God. We will see the outpouring of the spirit"
" I don't want to preach about speaking in tongues and get out messages and doing it the right way and moving in the spin, the spinner room of God. And if that of the nine gifts of those, one of those gifts are healing and nobody wants to talk about it because we're so bombarded by what Fox News and CBS and NBC. And all these things are telling us that everybody's going to die such and such and such and such and were debating about why they got a vaccine or cure for this when this right, here's I cure for everything."
" This morning, can I be honest with you? I've been raised in church, all of my life and I and I'm grateful for my reason I'm grateful for the routers about it, but sometimes people that need you good and then attention can warp your mind to the point that it cripples you from doing what God wants you to try to make your mind up the stakes, a with it. Doesn't matter what's crowded around me. It doesn't matter what surrounding I'm going to Touch the Hem of God's garment, because I need a blessing in my life. Amen. And when we get back to turn,"
" Make sure we get to that place and we say, God, let us turn your, I believe you said, what's the answer? What is the answer? What's going on that woman? Need an answer in her life and we look at which the United States of America in this world does not have an answer for all the things and the turmoil that's going on, but it will turn our at the Christian people. The Bible says, if my people will humble themselves and pray and we turn our face back to God and we say God I still don't know about you."
" Services. Like what we once had. They mean, where we see the outpouring of the spirit of God. Now, I'm not know about foolishness, how do you know there's an outpouring of the spirit of God in their foolishness? But I'm talking about an outpouring of the spirit of God, when he said, I've got to get over there for the I've heard of a man. And I got to go over there where you sit, but Church, where the church world has failed throughout the years. Is they heard of a man?"
" I'm not coming back. I'm talking about being made in Jesus Christ. Amen. I'm talking about the one that said, I shed my blood for other blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. How many of you got a testimony this morning? They can say, wait a minute, God has brought me from where I never thought I would come from. They need you. God is Robin from places. I never thought I would come from. You say sister Katie, but somehow I get right back in that same place or somehow I get right back."
" Next time, Darkness. Let me reassure you this morning. That God has got Grace in your life, touch your life again, and again, and again. And again, I'm in the bottom one up and in one chapter of Psalms that every version of that, one chapter, he starts out by the mercies of God. When you every day, how many of us need the merciful god to be renewed every single day in our lives. And that's what he's there for us to renew his mercy and his grace sister handy. I'm hanging by fotolia."
"Now, the service will open, that will be at six above. I will be running the bus tonight. We run"
"Everything requires and everything, we really appreciate it and one other things I want to say, now, I told the boys last night to tell everybody, you know, Friday."
"Everyone that's here, let the Holy Ghost have its way here in this place where most of all over we pray God that you would just if there's anybody here that don't know you or is it a personal savior? We ask you now what you just touch their heart that they give their heart to you before it's too late - now you know what, the singing or less the singers Lord and Lord. And we pray you just give brother."
" Brother. Kenny, I don't want this morning. It's that he's never had before that. He would be able to preach your word Lord, and Lord. You would fill our hearts or security with your wisdom going out of your way. Just thank you for all that. You do go with Jesus name, we pray."
 Southwest winds will go. Reservations.

 This morning.
" Message that was on my heart. When I got up and sometimes I'm preaching things simply because I've been experiencing the last day or two, but I want to preach a thought this morning and I think will be a hell. I'm not listen, if you don't hang with me, I promise your daughter. Help you. I want to preach a thought this morning on out of Acts 16 on this fault, when Revival breaks out,"
" Out, when Revival breaks out, I've been praying for this meeting brother, Jimmy, we're not here to blow the, a door-to-door, own horn, or Pat ourselves on the back. But my entire family, the older ones that he is all the way up from my son, Josiah, that was singing on the end through myself, fasted for this meeting"
" Nobody planned. It kind of turned into a corporate fast, not just about this meeting. But about several meetings, we've got in some situations were praying about at home and and we were asking God and brother Jimmy I'm I listen, I'm getting too old to travel across the country just to breach of me. I got I got too much. I can be doing back home. There's too many other things that I could be doing."
 Instead of just saying I want out and North Dakota brings to me if I couldn't Northcote it's breaking me and I want to see God do something. I don't want to come out here at weights God's time the people's time and the Lord's money. I don't do it and I'm of the persuasion that there are some markers. That'll tell you revivals breaking out. There are some indicators. How can I say it that way? I'm trying to be Halal ethically. Correct cat?
" There are some indicators that will tell you Revival if break it out. And I believe that you're on the very Verge right here at Devils Lake and on the Spirit Lake, Indian Reservation of seeing Revival really break out. And I'm glad to be able to shake hands with a man of God and his precious wife and family and people that attend this church. I'm glad to know that I'm going to be able to say I was a part of seeing God do something that little Old Town."
" You may be at the throne room, brother. Jimmy we may not ever see it till we stand before him. But I'm looking forward to that myself. Look at Acts chapter number 16 and verse 1. This is dealing with the Apostle. Paul's missionary journey. It said then came he to derbe and lystra. And behold a certain disciple was their name, timotheus. The son of a certain woman which was a Jewish Jewish and believe"
" But his father was a great deal. Plication here is Bobble was sold out serving God and daddy probably want to say that it didn't stop Timothy from saying to Paul. I'll go with you on your missionary journey. The first thing that I understand about seeing Revival, you've got to have some willing workers, you've got to have some Timothy's that'll come alongside when you say we need to hang the curtain, they'll hang a curtain with you when you say how we need to get that set up. What did you do this?"
" If you say yes, sir, we'll go take care of it, Timothy was that to Paul, I believe that everything that Paul needed was wrapped up in a young preacher. Boy named Timothy, God gave him some women workers. May I say to you just as we need with workers on the road doing what we do here, we need women workers in the house of God brother, Junior need some workers that are come alongside the activity. Leading up to Revival, there were some women workers but also there was some leadership of the Holy Ghost."
" Ghost if you'll study this passage of scripture in the Bible said that when they left from the urban Bible said, Paul said in verse 3 he would go forth with him. He took him circumcised him, he got him ready for the ministry and the Bible said in verse 6 that when they had gone through phrygia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word and Asia afterward, they came to my CLS, a to go to the tenía but the spirit suffer"
" I want you to I want to point out something that I want you to take record of that. The Bible said in verse number 6, it said the Holy Ghost for bed on the preaching Asia and then in verse 7 it said the spirit suffered them not. Do you see the implication here? You see what the Bible is telling us. It's saying that they were Spirit laying nobody. Did they pick up some? Some people to work with them but they were seared laying and how they went and where they went, you can't just go where you want to, you better. Let the Holy Ghost."
" Leave him he couldn't go he's he couldn't go west. He doesn't come One Direction, they wouldn't, but one more Direction left, until read in. Verse number 10, the Bible said and immediately, the Bible said verse 9 and a vision appeared to Paul the night at there. Stood a man, a Macedonian pretty insane. Come over to Macedonia and help us. And after you had seen the vision, I'll mediately we Endeavor to go to Macedonia. Assuredly Gathering that the Lord had called us for the preach, the gospel to them. Here's what I'd say to you before I get"
" Number one, you gotta have willing workers number two, you better have the leadership of the Holy Ghost showing the Shady man. And number three, you gotta be completely obedient to exactly, like God said, Paul went across that little body of water went to Macedonia. And when he got there, he experienced a great Revival. Now, the pick up my reading and then I'll give you those indicators. Look down at verse number 14. When they got over verse,"
" Thirteen Revel and they got over across the seat of Macedonia. The Bible said it on the Sabbath. We went out of the city by Riverside where prayer was won't to be made. And we sat down and spake unto the women. You heard it right? The women, which Resort and thither. And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of I retire. Which worship God hurt us, whose heart, the Lord opened that she attended unto the things, which were spoken."
" She was baptized her and her house. She was all the same. If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, coming to my house and abide there. And she constrained us first over 16 and add. It came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her master's much, gained by Super Saiyan the same followed, Paul and us and cried saying,"
" These men are Servants of the most high God, which showing us the way of Salvation. This did, she many days but Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit, I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth to come out of her and he came out that same hour and winter Masters saw that the hope of their games was gone. They called Paul and Silas and Drew them into the marketplace unto the rollers that you remember the rest of the story."
" I'll fill in the blanks here. They took him in the marketplace. They tied them up, and they went to publicly, then they threw him in a jailhouse, left him bleeding and watching and Bruges. But Paul made his mind up in that jail. I don't care what they did to me, I don't care the threats. They threw at me. I didn't come here based on what I was going to get. I came here based on who sent me here and what I'm looking forward to seeing God, dude."
" He threw his little hands up in the jail had started. Worshiping God, may, I say to you, before I get into the depth of this, that sometimes God Waits on you to give him glory in the midnight hour before he'll ever come through for you, I believe when they started praising God, the Bible said the jail begin to shake, and the Earth began to quake. And the Bible said that the prisoners are the guards fell down like dead men and the prisoners door."
 Open and Paul and Silas were able to go free. Now I will ask you this question. How many of you want to see a earth-shaking while change it? Revival come to North Dakota. You will see that team and I believe I want to see it. I didn't come out here and fight held by the acre. I didn't come out here to just play tiddlywinks with the devil. I came out here to sing God's do something that cannot be explained printed on paper.
" First that people will write something later and say, you had to be there to experience what I'm trying to explain to you, but I believe it's going to start, just like this one did. There was a prayer meeting out of Riverside by a group of women, that decided it was important to pray. And they've been praying, no doubt for a number of days off and on have that particular day, here comes the Apostle. Paul, when he showed up at the Riverside, the Bible said, God open up the heart of a God-fearing woman. That was down there."
" They can, she was doing God spinning and saner gloriously. She took him into the house and Revival broke out in the region of Macedonia. May I ask you this question, if you want to see Revival, what indicators can't? You expect number one, when Revival breaks out the devil gets stirred up hitting, it'll witness get stirred up. The first indicator that"
" Tells you you're on the right path. To Revival is saying, don't like what you doing. Can I get a witness right there saying? Hey yeah and gears it may be that you're not seeking Revival. I'm not saying you ought to look for Satan to bullyrag him treat you bad but I tell you if you're going against him he's gonna do everything he can to stop you. If you're trying to exalt the lovely Lord Jesus, he's gonna do everything he can to shut you."
" Honey, if you don't, you're taking a team of people across and get out of sight and you got one agenda he's already fasted and prayed and salt doubt about it. He's don't try to tear transmission up hill, tribes best to tear up a camper. He'll try to have flat tires in the middle of nowhere. He'll get you so discouraged at beat down. He'll get you looking at each other across eyes because somebody burnt their breath stank. He'll do anything. He can to get you derailed from the Bible."
" State will get stirred up. You say preacher didn't happen? Yes. When Revival broke out a woman with a spirit of divination that Paul and Silas have their fall around saying these men are Servants of the most high God, everybody knew in town that she was as Loose as an alley cat and that she was a pi devil-worshiping woman and Paul just turned around and shit. That moment shop with us. She needs God, he rebuked her. The devil came out, she got gloriously shade."
" I say, we got Christians in our society, don't have the power to blow the fuzz off of Georgia Peach. But glory to God, they distill some people, I believe in the good. Holy ghost killing power for you. Honey, you're gonna encounter Devils. Yes, stop at a gas station the other day, and was a young lady beating on the back window of a car. Say it, let me out, let me out. I don't want to be with these people. I don't know where she did channel art been on."
" The hospital. One of our young ladies witness to her but the truth of the matter is there's people like that although this country they are full of the devil. They've been influenced by demonic activity and they just need to be set free. But don't you think for a minute honey? When you make your mind up that you don't serve God, you go set off for God, you're gonna give doll you. God, you going to tip to through the Tiptoe Through the roads into and eat bonbons and shit up in your high horse shit."
" No, you don't find held by the acre. This woman was set free. The devil tried to derail will be to God, but they kept on power. They kept on preaching, and kept on praying, they kept on pressing. You can't quit because I axle break sounds. You can't quit because you have a difficult day, you gotta catch the glory of God."
" Number one, the devil gets stirred up, the devil uses a tool of Deceit, the tool of domination and the tool of Destruction. But thanks be to God. They still some old-fashioned stuff soccer, that'll stay in a place for 30 years. That's right. We don't God, that should help from Macedonia lubitsch. A man, I believe the Lis are Macedonian call Preacher."
" Say this to you. I have been burned. The see God did something on this reservation. My daughter. Grace is here last year, she came out here and there was a little old, girl. The reservation that just got her attention."
" He was over the meeting over on the reservation and God, just use this little girl to strike a little compassion to my daughter's heart. And since we left out of here, let me say this to you, her and Melody, have both got a joint burden to come back at Christmas time. Give out some boxes to the Indian Children and Youth called Christmas to the West. I'm going to tell you that don't just happen."
" If you're not hurting for Revival you're not a burden to move forward with God. Yes, I told her this I said I'll be happy to oblige you with this. Goes any young person that's got a burden to do something, to make a difference in somebody's life, in the kingdom of God, needs to be cheered on Biggs to be encouraged. Needs to be fine, but she's trying to put up to $50 per box."
" Up to 250 boxes. Now I know I don't do the math. I don't know research. They 2,500 children hotel reservation. At least registers may I say to you, 25 hundreds of tall tale. That would be, I think. Well, I do. I'm not good at math, that's over $100,000. If you did $50 the box, maybe it's that right? My getting that, right?"
" Well, maybe maybe not, I don't know. That's a lot of bunnies. All I can say, hey, good at math lean but I believe this, I believe we can come back at Christmas time. We can try to have a Revival service with him young people. We give out some Christmas boxes and a slice of pizza and Jesus name. Amen. And they're never know how far a lot of go down the road. It'll go back into somebody's house and show them that they somebody that don't even live in your region. It cares about your soul. Um, headband Bible breaks out, don't you can Mark once"
" Down the devil ain't gonna like it when you start planning Christmas boxes and you start planning to help some young person, get the gospel in the hole and it lifts their Spirits. Look at door Heaven. Don't you think for one minute that all hell ain't gonna salt you? It jump on your back but an indicator.

Got to have something different, don't they know convict in his right mind would have the door swung, open, it would sit right here and wait on judgment. You boy shit. Here, they something in. Y'all did."
 Then everybody else. Can I tell you? They need to see something different in the Christian. We can't always be bellyachin and complainin cause it may affect somebody's Spirit. They need to see that we're different. We've got somebody inside of us. That's changed the way we think. Change the way we talk. Change the way we walk change everything about it. I said somebody in this shit. All the pray that God will shake up somebody in this town this week.
" Week it may come to a Bible school and children bombarding the house with the songs. We gonna teach them, it may come through. I didn't meet them. Somebody feeling God, shake them and stir them up. We need Revival in America, paid back."
 How we go have it.
 Christian's get prayed up.
" When's the last time you saw God and said, sit Revival quit using it."
" What use it all that manipulation in your mouth? I pray all the time. All day it. What I asked you when's the last time you actually got on your knees and said, God send Revival to Devils Lake North Dakota I said specific out of your mouth not lord said Revival to America."
 That's good. Praying.
" What about this? God, send Revival to the homes and our church?"
" See the Bible to the Spirit Lake Indian Reservation, several powerful telling the coldest to India, send Revival to our mayor. And councilman of our town said Revival. Something we can physically visibly, see it. And we can feel the vibration Comet. So reverberating all the way from the courthouse to my house. Y'all with machete man, brother. Jim"
" I called your brother Jim. I called you, brother. Jimmy, I'm just glad you like me because I don't know which one you go. Buy 30 years."
 Thirty years.
" A lot before I learned a lot. The brother, we get too old."
" So with Perry, white will revive, we need Revival, 20 minutes."
" We got people that gave their time, bought me a couple of again."
 Give their energy.
 Gave their money.
 And we certainly don't want to waste this week of squandering.
" I don't want to waste this week in squandered. I want to see Revival. If my people which are called by my name,"
 Chao.
 To the car.
 Go ahead and quit deferred and I'm right and you're wrong.
" The Humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways. Then then they had, will, I hear from Heaven, would have God's not here because we've not tumbled ourselves, not sought its face."
" For my Wicked Ways. God said, I don't hear nothing you say, yet the first three, prerequisites. Have got to come into play before. I'll ever hear."
" Then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal our Land. If We Ever Needed healing in America, it's now, amen. So much racial tension and division. Now, say something to you."
" if I cut open a black man's arm and cut my arm up, my blood go, bleed, the same color,"
" But I stop and tell you we got to get over this color, this racial stuff and I'm better you better your lamps and I'm hired you or I'm not being unkind, I'm just being realistic. We need God to heal our land. Hear you? Do you want God to heal, your land? Well, here's what I'll ask you to do. Y'all. See how we built this? This Pulpit area."
 We build it just High Enough.
 That a person could do this.
" - this is not the most comfortable position, but it sure. Beats you have a nail all the way to the ground."
 You'll behind height way up in the air.
 I ain't gonna go there.
 God.
" First of all, I come before you and I ask you God, to search out my heart."
 See if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me into the way of Alaska.
" I confess every sin, every selfish way every prideful, thought, every sinful act, you might have to get real specific about those things. And that God, I humbly ask you, I seek your face. I'm going to turn from my Wicked Ways but I draw it night at you. I know you'll draw nigh to me. You said you would? It's God. I'm asking you please. What you said really?"
" The Devils Lake North Dakota God, I'm asking you specifically, would you send it to this property? This week? Draw people into this tent. That didn't even know they were coming. God, God to use me as a vessel to reach people today. When I eat, use me as a vessel to talk to somebody at the gas station, in the grocery store. Oh God, you gonna have to get busy with God. God, start hearing from heaven."
" I might ask you this question, he's gonna play Help Lord softly in the background."
" I'm telling y'all, Revival is going to be up to y'all."
" You say it? Oh, it's up to God. No, no, he said it's up to you. He said yeah, there's a conditional word right there. If"
" He said, I thought it and go out. Yeah, my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked. We thin. Yes, it's up to you and God if you'll do the first part got to do the last part, you may not do it the way you think, but he'll do it his way and you'll know it's coming. But that's how God works. God cannot tell a lie. He said that this word I believe it's true. Hey man,"
" So here's my question, how many of you want to see God do something this week that you can't take credit for? I can't take credit for but God the Holy Ghost will be absolutely proud that he put his stamp opponent. How many of you want to see Revival this week? I want you to get up from your seat. Help me, pray around these Alders and less ask God, to help us. We met. If you can't kneel, you kneel in your seat with your head mouth and your eyes closed, I'm asking you to come."
" Um, let's take God for Revival in this County, in this shitty, in this state, in our region in the United States and let it spill off all over the place."
 We're praying together.
 What brighten together as a body?
" How about the clouds their way? Our God. Who really cares? You'll carry your burden. He'll see, you safely eat."
 Hey.
 I need help from above.
Who were you?
"We're starting to see, folks, starting to trickle, back in after coronavirus. And it's good to have Julie and Brandon back with us for the first time since all this broke out and she's don't have child here. July the 15th or somewhere thereabouts. Amen. And I ain't you glad to have them back with us today. Amen."
" But I've made my mind up that greater is he, that is in us and he that's in the world. Amen. And the Bible said that the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the church. Satan would love to attack round. Citrate four doors off the church. Shut us down. He loved for Coleman to say if I was would have shown up"
" Return to this problem in churches that shut their doors as a result of it. But that's the grace of God. We're going to be a light on the top of the hill. What used to be a watering hole with alcohol, today is a place of worship, lifting up the King of Kings getting Living Water. If you plan on that, put your hands together and give a fuck"
" If you have not registered your children, you need to register them. You can go and see brother, Anthony Miss Kim or you can see Miss Cynthia. She knows how to do that. We want to get the kids register. We're high-tech redneck. We're doing it online now. Amen. And"
" You don't want to use them online to register your kids, or I don't want to be some paper. We have those too, but we wouldn't be visitation yesterday working on the property. Got things ready? We are super excited. We will be working. Anybody that follows rules that can spend a few hours with us today after church. Go pick, you up a hamburger. Pick up somebody to meet us at the property.

Listen carefully will be fed, five o'clock and if you come at 5 and you're not a worker will feed you and feed your kids. We are going to be sure every night there's food available."

Can somebody say we've been on that side?"

If you are excited, about our first annual BBS and you are excited about God and his power, and the fact that he's going to reach some children with the gospel. I want you to put your hands together and give God controls."

" We're gonna have a good time in Jesus name and I'm thankful for the for the fact that God has sustained. I know I got to sorry more about my hand but God has sustained the church through this time and I am grateful for that achieved. Save me I mean the light bills paid. God has been so favorable to us. That every bill is current carrying a witness, right?"

We got a special gift for my father, we got a special gift for the mothers and we've got a special gift for The Graduate."

 Y'all in here is huge but they show the lady to do this that she felt my God. It's burning her about this. I'm glad that God will carry you when they say man I don't know what you have gone through but I promise you man how many of y'all have ever seen that that thing Footprints in the Sand. It talks about how that I went through life and never discourage and he goes through a whole gamut of all kinds of negative things and he
" He said, but the one thing I notice, when I look back, there was only one set of footprints in the sand and he said and then I wondered why God. And then I realized it was seeing that he was carrying me and I don't know about y'all, but there have been times in the 30-plus years of being saved that God has scooped me up. I was weak as water. I didn't have the strength that go on. I"
" The problem pal in and say I'm finished with God. I want to say it's over. I can't, God can't fight another battle. I've been in the point. I know this might shock from y'all, but in 30 years of preaching, they've been times. When I said I can't preach another stupid, I have felt so overwhelmed. But you know, I found during those times of my life is when the Lord was undergirding me Michael, hit the light except the laugh."
" The Lord was undergirding me and he was carrying me from the difficulties of my life. I want you to listen while Whitney sayings they say, whether on He will carry you."
 Jessie.
" Thank you for carrying that load helping me through the difficulty of my life. They don't sing it one more time. I want to ask you if you feel like what I think, what let it play, it play, softly testify."
" There were times that I ran from you, but I could look back and see that he took care of me, even when I did not want him."
" I can look through this lyrics, All These lyrics and I could say, yes, I have found myself asking where he's been"
 But I can only do it through crimes. That's right. That's right. People ask me every day. Why are you doing so late?
 What is your job toys? Why aren't you playing your life?
" I don't know what he has in store for me, but I do know it's right here. Praising him everything."
" That's just fine with your mama. We don't we don't feel like that's gonna be your status and what we want. Out of every one of our kids as if to be in the perfect will of God. And this hold the microphone with the you hold a microphone book out. If it's just been to church to teach children, you do that for the Lord. We're going to pray for her because you got no idea of a pressure. So young person gets it when they're 19 and 20."
" Man, there's an old salt of hail that comes again."
" But everybody else around, he's got a boyfriend or girlfriend or they're married and I'm not married, they've got a job but they got a new car and they've got the answer that God status of a got there. Let me tell you something, honey, as long as you are with my God, that's the only person you need to get. Give your allegiance to a man, don't you give it to this world, don't you? Give yourself to Jesus?"
" What what Jesus will do with your life. Amen. I told Whitney this morning, we were there. Whoever the song I said, I told my daughter Amanda, many years ago, I said, Sometimes some of the greatest songs that God uses the minister who you are songs, that have impacted you and I said, it's obvious. This song has touched your life, it's obvious God. Gave you the song in the night when you needed in the grave."
" Honest. And I said, honey, that will transfer. I said, I told my daughter one time you can you can sound like a screeching cat but if it's transferred from the heart it don't mind her. The Acoustics. What matters is is the Holy Ghost. Yes, coming out of the year and being poured out on somebody else, it was in my daughter realize it didn't matter. She cried the Miller show you"
 Didn't matter our boy screams a little bit because she didn't hit the keys. Just why what matters is that? That song for a lot of me?
 To the congregation.
" And I told Whitney, I said it's going to do. You want?"
 It's already done. You heard her testify with tears or offer Face.
" It's already doing it and I'm telling y'all. Some of you need to be on an altar saying, thank you for carrying me. Thank you, too and I was depressed."
" Rejected you carried me? When I was, neglected, you carried me? I don't know what time God's ever carried to, but show it, show it by his presence up in this house this morning, if you didn't, I"
" Hard. Say, thank you, God. That you carried me when I could carry myself. Amen. I don't sing it again. And I will ask how many of you"
" Ever find yourself asking, dog, worries me it, has anybody done that in recent days with your hand of God, where you then the rest of your life?"
 How do you say?
" As a youth group in Tennessee and now we're still saying it in Greensboro Georgia. Amen. Listen to the song. It says, he'll Lord, if you need help, these a call away and they listen to this."
 Real quick.
" We're glad for the word of God. And for the Bible, say Glory Glory."
" Children, children, children, all the children in his class enrollment Bible schools, ladies, hold a piece of paper out of town. They got Patrols."
" the Bible says, let the redeemed of the Lord say so, and by the way, all the kids are leaving, he made it or the churches, but I all let the redeemed of the Lord say, so,"
" I forget what I do then you ought to just let the devil know who sighs you really, don't, you know what grades does praise. Let the devil know we're paying Allegiant and giving homage to one person and that's gone. Amen. And so every now and then you just need a good, praise break a man every now and then you just need to break loose and just praise God. And I just want to let you know that praise and celebration is in very much or around here, and we don't have a bit of problem."
" what you saying hallelujah we don't have a bit of problem that you saying glory to God, we don't have problems with you raising your hands and and something your feet and even taking a lap if he gets real good but just be sure you're rapping for Jesus cause you ain't you liable to break a leg but we'll do it for Jesus to remind you of that because sometimes I think the devil steals, our praise and tries to steal our joy and then"
" We come to church and and with can't even say Glory or a men who can't even work on key. So I want you to know that you can give God the glory. First said no chapter number 30, I want you to look with me out of story that I started preaching on last week. God gave me one morning early. I got up and was praying and seeking may God just gave me a word and I want to give you today and it came to pass when"
" Not even all this mean what kind of sick lag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded? The South I don't miss who invaded the South the amalekites and ziklag and smitten, thick line and burned it with fire. What sounds from me you don't hate me and I taken captive women or taking the women captives that were there in. They slew not even great or small but carry them away and went on"
" Their way. In other words, they went into this shitty David, and his men had been a vital and while they were gone, the enemy came in the amalekites and they came into town and they burned the houses down and they took all the women and children is all the member on the battlefield fighting and they took him off. The Bible says, in verse 3 and David. And his men came to the city and behold, it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive. First of all,"
" Then David and the people that were with him, lifted up their voice and wept until I understood that there's got to be a nun till woman in your life. He will never get healed until you get to a nun. Kill moment, you've got to get to that point to say untilled, I can't wait no more. They had no more power to weed. I don't know if you've ever been there honey, but I had when you wear to your eyes look like somebody punched."
" You with a punching bag and they were swole up like pigs on the end of your eyelids. I have wept to my eyes were swollen so bad I could only see out of them. But can I tell you? David said, the men well until they could weep no more than the Bible goes on to say in verse number 6, and David was greatly distressed. I want to stop right there for just a minute. I looked at word distress and no doubt. He would be distressed."
" I got something to give you from the Lord. No doubt he wants to stress. The Bible says that he was greatly distressed. What? Just a little bit of pressure. It was great pressure. It wasn't just a little bit of trouble. It was great trouble. Notice for the Bible says, he was greatly distressed. I look the work of stress. It is an adjective. When it's used in the word, distressed is."
" It's used as an adjective. It means to suffer from anxiety to suffer sorrow and pain it to be impoverished. If it's used of furniture. Or clothing, the word distress, you ever heard of the stress, he's a Furniture under stress couch. If the choose the furniture or clothing, it means it Bears, the marks of age and it mayor's to marks of where, can I ask you a question? Have you ever been so,"
" Begin to affect the way you looked at the affected to, countless it, affected your wrinkles, in your skin. I looked in a mirror other day. I said deal or I will have to have some of that we can lift the stuff. One day man, I found it older. I get a longer my head gets and the bigger my ears, get my behavior, my eyes get my bigger, my stomach clocked over there, somebody's with the rocks are so y'all"
" But he'll catch up my stretch marks. From, where old him, he can fight battles. Now, it's also used in a verb form to me to afflict with great pain. David was afflicted with great pain, toned-down, he had anxiety or sorrow, he in trouble, he had worried he had bother"
" Pressure on him, he had stress and strain on it. You put the word means in a vertical distress means to be embarrassed. David was embarrassed that while he was on the battlefield, fighting the enemy Round Shot. That possessions, can I ask you a question? What are they want to be worse than that? Here's a Mighty Warrior fighting for Israel. And he goes home is old Pals is in distress, is whole house is in Ruins."
" He's looking at her ass huh? Actions of people and he's just absolutely embarrassed. It was so bad. Verse 6 says it this way and David was greatly as I'm going somewhere, y'all gonna hate women because it ain't always gonna be depression. I got some good news to give you before we get done. Eleanor say glory to God and the people Spate of stoning him because the soul, no sir, why don't want to Stony their souls cream. Can I tell you didn't say they're mine was created in say there."
" It's at their soul tree. You know what he's saying? He said the emotional part of it was speaking. The emotional part I was lashing out at payment that they were looking at David saying, it's your fault that our women and children are gone. It's your fault that our sons are gone. It's not our fault. It's your fault and they said, we almost all you and leave you for dead. You know, it's one thing when you're going under pressure yourself, but when everybody else starts putting the blame on you,"
" You it really gets intense in. I mean it's just you with the pressure, he can handle it. If you're pressuring yourself, you know how much pressure to put on yourself? But if somebody else is putting pressure on you and somebody else some people that you thought would be your closest Ally has turned their back, it puts stress on you that you don't know how to recover from David was under such a load that he didn't know what to do. So he did what only a person can do in that."
" But they had a lot to do some friction right here. Hallelujah. In my britches are stay up. I'm not letting you get that belt. Listen, and listen, but David encouraged himself in the Lord. His God. David said, I don't have the choir, do, encourage me. I don't have a large congregation to encourage me. I don't have friends to encourage me. I don't even have my closest preachers to encourage me."
" He said everything around me is turned upside down, but there's one thing I can do, when I can't find encouragement from that direction, I can find it from that direction and he encouraged himself in the Lord. I will ask you a question. How many of you have been in the stress lately? You don't know how you do."
" What time was he under stress? But honey, I'll come to tell you. Why don't you turn to the wall? And it'll give you strength to fight the battle and, and encourage yourself in the one that said, I will show how one that's devil. Also, find the one who shot people to have for crutches, what does not good shit to him? And his wisdom is beyond all comparison. His MO is map unsearchable. His power is what happened. I said, why don't you encourage yourself?"
" You might not find encouragement at the church house, you might have find encouragement at your house. You may not find it Courage been on the job. But honey, I got news for you. You encourage yourself in the Lord and the goodness of the Lord."
 You don't know what to do that.
" They have been winning now after mile, after mile, after mile, they were victorious, man. And all of a sudden he said, I didn't go home, the me and load up, six hundred, Miley me and warriors Killers men. That knew how to get a hold of the sword and beat the enemy. All that know how to come capture and conquer."
" They're heading home. I can see one of those men on the horse saying that there's smoke coming from our Direction over there. There's a way that that looks like a whole place, and I can see David kick that pork and start picking up speed. I don't know if you can hear him as he starts speaking under his way up. And she says, oh my can't be surely, that's not sick, like, surely that's not."
" Surely that's not where my family is Sherman. And as it got closer, the smoke is billowing up in the air. I said Somebody's to stay with me. Let's smoke battling up in the air and all of a sudden David realizes his worst nightmare while he was on the battlefield. Fighting for Israel. Satan was fighting for his house."
" While he was doing his best to run the race, the enemy was attacking and its own home. When David showed up in town, he looked on that place. He saw Nothing But Smoke and Ashes and then what the soul, inside his house is burnt to the ground. And the Bible said it was so bad that they took every child, they took every son, they took every wife of these men and these me and again,"
" Can I ask you a question? What's wrong with showing a little emotion? I'm a big, I got problems. When people said well, I just don't think me. I'm gonna tell you something. I get affected. It stays on me a long time running. No women say that. I have to shake things off every now and then but bathing in begin to weep. I don't, you know this I believe God has given us the permission in this text to show a little bit more motion every now and then, you just gotta let it out, honey. A woman to let it out my man, I'm trying to hold it in and it pours and just show one"
" And they get bigger over time, as a matter of fact in baby situation, no, people around him and gotten better over and they started blaming somebody. That's what baroness does that. We hold it in your hand and you begin to meditate on it and just say do it produces a spirit of bitterness in you put a spirit of resentment on you and puts a spirit of nature to poke. It's not what God intended for you, honey. He intended for you to be free of bitterness, he intended for you."
" I've been gypped but listen to me. You got to stop for a minute and realize the impact of what he saw shook it to his core. I don't know if you've ever will because honey, the Bible said they wear, these were my teammate and he for Troy trained. Fighters have a weakened. They realize they could win this battle. It was too big for the other. The other thing was too strong, but honey, can I stop and pay you? They wear until they could we"
" Eat no more. They put it all out with God and then became a nun till moment. Can I ask you a question and you come to that, um, kill Moment In Your Eyes. One moment of saying, when you decided to not go to keep rehashing it that you're not going to type about it anymore, you're not gonna talk about it just because every time you did it, make you mad. You got to come to kill moment and say I hate them what, sorry to play action. I hate repair."
 Are you showing funny? One thing I came to myself?
 I'm bothered by.
" Sometimes I can control but sometimes I get bothered by. Hey, came out of nowhere. I'll give you a proposition. Cannot do that same, man. I believe it's in for my shoulder. I didn't preach his last week, but I'm going to preach today."
" Every Christian, I'm preaching to somebody, maybe not, you may be with me. Every Christian will find. There are times when they get hit with the unexpected. Covid-19 was that way. Nobody saw that coming. We heard a little Rama's of people being sick in China on the evening news, I somewhere else."
 Then I started hearing Rumblings of people start to die over there.
 When it's over there.
" And then before, you know it Trump standing up saying, what need to curtail all quiet out of China. Boy that through the Democrats in alarm. Well, praise"
" You're funny holiday does something he's prejudiced when he don't do it, he's slowing the cowboy. The man ain't got no happy medium. He does everything he can to make it right but it's always opposition. You don't wiggle reason why he's getting such opposition and I'll say what I heard somebody else saying I agreed with it, I believe that he's done more for the church. Listen to me over the past presidents of my lifetime that I can remember any president doing a church. I never had a president."
" I've never had a president stand up and say the churches are going to be considered essential workers so they can go back to worshiping God. I never had a president stand up to put his hand up. So I got you back over here, I'm gonna help you opened up certain Financial Avenues. So churches with Me Shelter, the economic concert I'd say I've never had a president who's to say. You can't believe it."
" I think we all get a little political here because honey, if you're gonna go out there and pull the pole for somebody at leaves and stronger, a little babies in the womb and you'll even pull the phone for somebody and agreed with alternative lifestyle and being okay, it's not okay."
" This morning we got something to say hey man, every Christian will find her times in their life when they get hit with the unexpected I will give you this as pay to get good. I'll be when you have had all you possess go up in smoke. When you had all you up, take it away. There are five reactions, you can take the, how am I preaching to myself right here. Young women show you my number one, the first"
" In is this you must reflect on past victories when you are so discouraged that you want weird, you need to start thinking about what God's done in your past when David encouraged himself in the Lord, you don't even doing. He was thinking about a time when he didn't have a family, he was thinking about a time when he didn't have any children, he was thinking about a time when he would just sit on the outside of nowhere. And nobody knew his name. Nobody knew he was even on the map."
" But God sent a prophet out there in the middle of the Wilderness should to say they are going to anoint you as a king can I stop and tell you David started thinking I've been anointed by God. I've been anointed to do what God called me to do. Hey listen to me when you get discouraged like about that anointing God gave your life.

But that land may not necessarily be his land, he is there long enough to need a house but it's not"
" Long enough to make himself a permanent resident. As a matter of fact, he is, he is he really has no legal rights, he has no social standing. He is a stranger and Exile who lives in a foreign land, the word pilgrim. However, means this it carries the meaning of a more temporary time than the stranger. The word pilgrim cares.

If they like you're stopping at a campground and check it in when he was in a tent or a camper and you pay for the fee to stay at night, but in the morning, you're packing the camper up and your head going down the road. You know what Peter saying to these people? Hey, don't get too used to where you are because this really ain't your land. This really ain't where you belong.

He said your citizenship put is no longer going to be based on."

And you've used to come to that you pulled yourself into that way of and you know what you're out there and all of a sudden you're enjoying it but then all of a sudden party starts up. It starts getting late."
" And everybody starts getting drunk and everybody starts passing out and then your best by yourself and you're alone and you're broke. And you wake up sick and you wake up saying what did I do and you don't know and they long until that season comes to an end. And then you start realizing what did I contract something that I did? I do something. I'm gonna be ashamed of what something caught on camera that I won't see. And then, I, yes, leave. You are tiptoeing around the truth."
" Do it because you have no idea. You know, that is that is what the devil represents to you as the best life. But you don't tell you, the end of it is a car wreck or main body. They don't tell you the indominus a broken relationship and emotional baggage. If they don't tell you at the end of it, you'll be thrown away like a pack of cigarettes cause you're done with you. They don't tell you that when it's all said and done honey, you are thrown away. You are a nobody and"
" And the people that get used to it, right? You have now pushed themselves away from you and your father has come to an end but in my present he says I was a nude. He said I have been chosen out of that mess. Oh, come on. Over here with me, you don't need to do that anymore. Have fun. I'll get you high on the most high chamber and the creation."
" He says, we have a new comedian. He said I'm a royal priesthood. He said, I get the fellowship with God. Say he said, we don't have a new communion and we're a new creation. He says, number three, watch this, we're not only a new car. We have a new character. He says, now you're a holy nation. Nobody look at you. Like they used to they don't they look at what you've done and start size and you up based on their assumptions obvious. Now, they look at you and say, that's"
 Little bit about that person of can't leave the other day. There was a preacher from Kentucky preaching.
" And he got the preaching about he said in his past, let us, but maybe I'm not ready to run thinking about. He said in his past, he had done something that caused him to have a felony attached to his name. A felony is a pretty serious. You go prison for felony"
" He said it was a setup. It was a steam. He said, I'm not excusing. I was not the wrong. He said, but it was a sting operation he said and I was killed tiphaine in the middle of that mess. He said and they come and they busted everybody and he said, hi, I was told by the probation officer. Bring your toothbrush to court because you probably not going home."
 What day is the only thing you bring your toothbrush to court?
" because you're probably,"
 Going to prison. You're not going.
" he said, miraculously"
 he was put on probation.
" He said, but yet his his record had a felony."
 And you can't shake it. So when it's on your record ask Nathan Tucker know him in shame and when it's on record unless they is sponging.
" The word is fun. Just interesting. It means, unless they go back and they erase it and where it cannot be traced or found anymore."
" He said, but yeah, I have a felony on my record."
 He said this.
" He said one day he served his probation and he tried to do, right? It got saved by the grace of God. God forget to work in his life called him to preach and one of his church members. So why don't you write a letter to the governor asked him to expunge your record?"
" He thought that never do that, but he said, one day, he got impressed the write a letter. He wrote a letter telling the governor. Yes, I was killed T of what? I did. Yes, I am. But I'm not the same man. I used to be."
" I've been saved. I'm pastor at the church and he had sold his church members write letters on his behalf. He said, he said, he called the governor's office and they said, well, you can send it in but but he's got"

" Let's go to the Lord in a word of prayer. Father, you are, you are so good. I'm just saying, what a friend we have in you. It's remarkable that we could even be considered your servants, let alone your friends, and you call us family, Jesus, through your blood, through your sacrifice, through your death. On the cross were ushered into your family, were welcomed into your home and we get to be yours."
" And it is such an honor and we celebrate that this morning. We worship you this morning, thinking about how good you are, how good you've been to us, how good you've been to each individual in this room?"
" Father, we pray for every single burden, carried in here. This morning, I'd, you know it, you know, every single care, every concern, every burden that people brought in with them this morning, I pray that you answer those prayers. You comfort those hurting you heal those broken. You, you free. Those who have been captive. Father, I pray that you do what you do."
" ushering in the Kingdom to the presence of those here and those connecting with us on the internet, father, pray that the"
" Just your incredible presence is felt and lives are changed and people are discipled and get to know you better. Father, we pray for our community as we go out into the community tonight and do mobile church and pray. That will be impactful. That will see, people come to know you, that don't know you yet that will see people make decisions to accept you. I pray that our church will show the love of Christ in such a clear and evident way that it will be life-changing for"
" Only ask, but for those out in the community, we love you so much. Father, we believe you want to use this church to do incredible things as we get closer to, or we get to hear from your servant Josh and his new message that he's prepared that you've laid on his heart. I pray that you'll bless his words. We don't want to hear from an individual. We want to hear directly from you."
 We believe your word is powerful and we believe that you're going to carry it through him this morning. And so we're eager to listen to this message. We love you so much Jesus Christ. We pray for your continued presence and continued power. It's in Jesus name all God's people said
" Okay, if we can have the ushers come forward, we're going to continue to worship through the receiving of tithes and offerings. This is the opportunity in the service, we get to just honor God and show him that we are committed to him and that we trust him with our finances. So he give 10% and more to our to our Lord and savior through the giving of tithes and offerings. I'm going to ask if you'd like to pray for us."
 I tasted and seen of the sweetest of where my heart becomes.
 And my shame is undone.
 Your?
 Let us become more aware of your presence. Let us experience the glory of your goodness. Let us become more aware that
 Holy Spirit. You are welcome here. Come flood.
 Place and filthy your what our hearts long for to be your brain.
" How's it going? Well, my friend."
 This is definitely the part where you come up. Yeah.
" This is an exciting moment. I'm gonna pray with you before we launch you off into this, okay?"
 CeCe. This is this is my perspective. Every single Sunday. Nobody sits in the front three rows because I think I don't know if they are spit when I talk halitosis.
" Bad breath. And all right, well, I'm going to pray for you father. Thank you so much for Josh's willingness to take a. Take a big step forward in his faith and his exploring. What it is. You've designed him to do it. Pray that you will bless his efforts as we have already prayed. Father, nobody in this room wants to hear from him. They want to hear from you. And we believe it's your word and you're going to be speaking through him today. So we're anticipating a movement of the spirit this morning, we're anticipating"
" Painting. Something that will be transformational for everyone in this room because your word has the power to transform lives and we believe in that father. I pray that you will keep any nerves, calm any, any any of the strangeness of public speaking. And just get that out of the way and use him in a mighty way expecting that now. And going forward. We love you so much. Jesus Christ. Amen."
 It's hot.
" Hey, y'all."
 What if I I get up here in completely bombed the sermon.
 It would have done. Y'all come back again though.
 What if I trip over these chords up here?
" Even worse. What if I trip and fall on Colton's? Most prized possession, get to our and busting of thousands punished what if when I leave here?"
 Her.
" What if when I leave here and we all go get lunch and I have my mouth settle. My number three, from Zaxby's, I wanted to get it back to find us a bite taken out of it. What if I'm so steamed about him? So hot about it, I have to get my truck and drive in a desolate. Dirt, road and Robinson where there's no cell phone service."
" in order to cool my head only to run out of gas,"
 What if it's more than just a tank of gas? What's the transmission?
 What if it's a crack piston then what would happen if my girlfriend leaves me after she realized what kind of doofus I really am.
" What if I get my all my mind, my body and my soul at work, only to be. Let go because of budget cuts."
 What if my upcoming doctor's appointment? This week doesn't go as I plan to take?
" What if the rash is gone, Colton comes out to be cancerous."
 What if I lose everything that I hold? Dear and love.
 What if I'm alone? What if I die a lonely old man just sad?
" Yeah, no, it's good. As I do covid-19 is produced high levels of Stress and Anxiety, this last couple years, more than anything. That I think I know of in my lifetime as I can physically. See, and remember hearing."
" But I sure y'all these anxieties these feelings, these words dread and fear that we are all the sphere. The last two years you know of going to the grocery store simplest that has these families have not new. They're not new. They've been around for a long time."
 They've been around for a really long time.
 I want to go to scripture to Matthew 6:25 through 34.
" Therefore, I tell you do not worry about your life. That sounds pretty simple doesn't."
 What will you eat or drink or about your body? What you will wear?
 Is life not more than food and the body more than clothes.
 Look at the birds in the air. Do they not sow nor reap or store away in Barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they can anyone of You by worrying at a single IRT life?
" I promise you, we can reduce our life by worry. And why do we worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow? They do not labor or spin yet? I tell you that these even and Solomon, and all of his Splendor was dressed like one of these flowers."
" Is that how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today gone tomorrow, throw it in the fire, it comes with the seasons. People actually cook with grass back then."
" Will he not much more clothe, You O ye of little faith?"
" So, do not worry, saying, what shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? Or what shall we wear for pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them. But first seek his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you. Therefore, there's therefore again, therefore, do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own"
 We are definitely living in a 40 of time.
 What if I don't have enough money? What if I'm what if my kids tuitions in paid? What if my mortgage in paid? What about the government? That's a big one. These days.
 What about my parents? What about my siblings?
 What about my health?
 We do indeed live in an Age of Anxiety.
" In the Greek language whirring xiety had the same meeting. It means having to decide just violated and distracted heart. It's basically like, you know, I mean we've all experienced it, you know, you when you, when you have your mindset, you know, you wake up, wake up with something on your mind, your subconscious makes you sleep with it all night. You wake up. That's the first thing on your mind when and then it you just eats at you all day long each you too."
" Point of you're just miserable, it will make you physically ill. It will make you not be able to perform it. Work make you just completely not holding."
 You also uncertain about today on something about something from the past.
" Definitely are uncertain about tomorrow and the days ahead. And again, these feelings of anxiety, are nothing new. Let's think back to Jesus time."
" The people that Jesus time were under a strict, vicious Roman rule, they were taxed to death."
" There are there Foods think about the feet that they're eating, then they their system of farming and harvesting."
" Had to been hatching then, so precise if a drought would come in."
" It will completely Wipe Out the crops. If if a flood come in, it will wipe out a cross. They had no means of storing a drought could wipe out your food, your neighbors food, your kids Foods until, you know, they were really looking for where their next meal is coming from."
" They were taxed very, very heavily."
 Think about this for a man was working in the field all day long.
" He could come home after from sunup to sundown work to his hungry, wife and hunger. Kids in sheer disappointment, because what he's been working for his fruit have been purposely given to the Romans taken by the Romans and suppression"
" And Jesus saw this as a major problem, he saw the worries and anxieties of his people and thought enough to speak about in The Sermon, on the Mount, he's not speaking. This passage in a condemning voice been a desire to free you."
" Guy wants to strip away for the distracting you from this Kingdom, these distracting us, our worries and anxieties and fears. And I've always loved this part of The Sermon on the Mount. And to me, he seems like he's"
" Speaking to the crowd and more like a, come on, y'all, you don't worry about this. You know, we if you believe you have a God in heaven and he will provide"
" Kind of like, you know, this is that all you got because I got to worry about well in 2003 for me and my family worried really hit home."
" It was my mom's birthday, July 10th."
" She was inside making herself. A birthday cake and me and my nephew were playing the Xbox. I was home for summer in college. My dad, who work the night before he was outside, we'd eaten the weed, eater started Island. I looked out the window and my dad passed."
 very suddenly massive heart attack and
" the thinking back, what grief worry, how would Mama? Make this? How am I gonna make it? How was she working, you know, Daddy still being a his, he was only 60. He was still a rider and we were just worried. How would we not only how would we? She has all not only mentally get past this, but physically with our worries, whether that's their needs and everything like that."
" But I promise you were in, won't make a difference on things outside of your control. That's God's territory, I'm not saying to quit your job or or not study for exams. No, sir. These are critical thinking times and have no time for lingering anxiety. They come and they go"
" I mean, God expects us to experience some anxiety, such as that."
" If I saw a snake come up, a new pastor Scotch foot."
" I would probably laugh first. But then I would say, hey man, get out of the way, but I would feel anxious right there for that one. Second, you know, worried about is going to buy."
 But it was be a passing anxious anxiety.
" I love in the scripture had Jesus illustrates nature, how you refers to Nature and he appeals to the birds of the air. They don't plant, they have no equipment to form a harvest."
" Yet God feeds him. Now all God's creatures automatically submit his Rule and it's the most natural thing you'll ever see, think about that. Like, I see a mama bird with her babies when it's raining. She'll do a wing over. I mean that's god-given since to take care of her babies."
" I definitely think we should take notes from these Jesus speaks about wearing the clothing, he speaks of the Lilies of the Field. And they have such a splendor that even Solomon, the richest man, the Old Testament can never equal to you."
" He closed the grass which comes in seasons. And as I mentioned swallow ago, they actually used to cook with gas."
 he will most certainly clothe you his children if he close that grass
" Are we to live with frustration? Exhaustion? See and worry. Absolutely not. If that's the case, God must have a plan to answer and subtle a heart, no matter what our situation arises settle these armies these anxieties God if God if we're in this part of the State of Mind, God's going to bring us out of it. Now he has a plan of doing that."
" What we're talking about that plan about is, is seeking his kingdom. The kingdom of God, singing and making your first priority,"
" Now, what is the kingdom of God when I think of a kingdom? I think of a castle. And King, you know, Mighty crown and servants people in the field horses. All that good job. But"
" They're all have one thing in common. They were obedient to the king. They serve under him, they obey his rule. They obey his laws. Now is God Almighty. Not the king of all Kings."
" We are to be service to him. We're to seeking first as in verse 33, but seek him and his kingdom first, and these will be added unto you."
" Think of it this way, if someone from another country wants to become a citizen of the United States?"
" They have to go through a steel to change the steps and changes and checks and balances, I guess you want to say. They have to embrace our constitution."
 Fast learner speak English.
" And they have to abide by our laws and our governance. They have to make a complete change from the laws that was in Mexico or Canada wherever you want to add in the blank from there to there. I mean, if they have a law there that doesn't suit our law here, they have to adjust our law."
 Citizen of the Kingdom.
" They had to run the scripture, we have to learn to cycle one another. We have to believe in the live, by the words written in red. We have to pick up our cross and follow those merciful Footprints to Calvary."
" All the Necessities that the unbelievers or the Bible says, Gentiles, or pagans Strife or will never be added unless you make his kingdom first."
" Now this doesn't work for a non-believer or someone who makes who takes pride in thinking. I don't need God, I got this, you know, I'd God does not be to be to be in this situation. I have right here."
" Nothing can happen that almighty. God, God will give anyone the means to handle any situation that is brought right in front of their feet by knowing his son Jesus Christ."
" Now, he's not committed to provide the needs and Necessities if you live without, according to his will and obedience."
 You have to be a part and join that Kingdom.
" Jesus lays it out in front of us. In a beautiful scripture, we've spoken about a problem, we spoke about the solution"
" And now we're going to dive into how to make it, look how your life will look once applied what Jesus said."
" Stop fighting him and submit to the kingdom. That's basically what you're saying is that just stop, stop fighting Tap Out, come be on my side."
 I started by giving up what if scenarios?
 Let's present and see what the opposite of these dreaded these anxious in these fearful feelings.
 Let me give you a word that describes it. Shalom.
 Can we all say shalom? Shalom? Thank you.
 All right. Shalom is peppered. Throughout the Old Testament.
" Shalom is defined as completeness welfare apiece, an Indescribable piece."
" I need peace where everything is in its place when everything is whole. Shalom is an awesome place to be in now. I mean, just everything's fine, you know, just nothing but filled with love nothing but no anxieties, no worries. I mean you're you're going to have that. But if you're living in shalom,"
 A lot of golf you like water off a duck's back because you know you have a father that will help you walk through any situation.
 Do you have or ever experience alone?
" If there's trouble at work, is there still Salome in your heart?"
" Do you have some at home? You have Stallone where you're sitting right now. Do you have so long with your kids, with your pants with your siblings? We all want and strive for social Omen that Jesus preached this message, because he wanted everyone to experience this. Shalom,"
" I've often when I was writing this and and what I didn't write it, Jesus wrote it. But when I Was preparing this, I kept thinking of Paul"
" Paul who had every right to say, why me?"
" What, what have I done? Wrong God. He was cast out in the ocean, you know, drift with them on place to drift board but he wrote in Philippians 4, 4 through 7 sitting in the dark prison cell rejoice in the Lord. Again,"
" Again, I say rejoice."
" Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand be anxious for nothing. Again, he says be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving, let your requests be made to be made known to God."
" Any the peace, which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ."
" If he can meet the needs of the birds and flowers, he can certainly meet our needs. His children."
" Now I really love for what he says and this kind of sums it up ye of little faith trust you trust trust in God. That means if I'm not trusting him, I'm not believing him."
" And I'm doubting him and I have major problems if I'm doubting. God, that's basically saying God. I know you're mighty, I know you're the creator of all things. I know you, you know, brought light into the snap of a finger, you know, you created all life but you can handle this, you can handle this, this problem is bigger than God me, what a proper thing to say, you know, that's the most powerful thing. Yes, that's absurd."
" God will allow you to get through anything. But only if you set your eyes on his kingdom first, y'all and trusting his son, Our Savior. Jesus Christ. Now, keep in mind, we don't serve an ignorant God when we pray and tell God, all the things that are bothering us on my heart's. All I worries, he's basically sitting there checking them off on a list. He already knows what you're saying before you say it."
" When we prayer, when we pray, we share our hearts with him."
" We're not giving him information that he doesn't already know. You may think we're all the same, you don't know my worries, my worries, if you knew the issue wouldn't be saying this, it's more complicated than you think."
" Ask you, is there anyone that God doesn't know? Is it any heart that he doesn't know? He counts the hair on our heads?"
" Maybe not mine, but he knows our past. He knows I present. He knows our future. He knows our next step before we take it."
 He has every one of our numbers show.
" Trust me, that being the case. If you think about it, why should we worry about anything? Why should we Fred of anything? It seems very silly if he knows our next step, if he knows our heart, if he knows."
 Where we going? Give it over to him. Give his wheels going to his will to God. Here it is. Whatever Direction you want me to go with this. I give it to you.
" He's an awesome. God, you need to face and you need to trust in Jesus in order to make this work."
" If you have a moment of anxious, let it roll off your back."
" God's got us, we serve an amazing and all-knowing God like I said let those anxieties come let them leave."
" If it's too big to, if it's too big to comprehend God's already. God is too big for our minds to conceive. It's not a critical thinking it's a god-given."
 Test.
 Everyone in the world wants shalom. Shalom of almighty. God. Protects us holds us and Comforts us.
" When we experience this, Shalom y'all."
 Which I did personally and 2020.
" Several years back, I went through what most people would dread to go through. I went through a divorce uncertainties goal or where you know how am I gonna make this work with a single income house?"
" How am I going to do this? Parenting thing, you know by myself you know for the most part and how am I going to be okay? And also be okay, enough to let my kids think that I'm okay, I've struggled with it. I made it happen. But I every day for about three years, I woke up with a heavy heart. I was did not have peace."
" I was paying my bills, but I mean, he was, it's very undescribable. How the the burden was on my shoulder. You've heard the felt like I had a book bag full of concrete, blocks, carrying around with it everyday. And"
" The last year, I hit my knees."
" So I'm going to hit my knees before this. I had been sick, the this whirring had given the kidney stones. I've had procedures with kidney stones. It's one thing had led to another. I fought with this spiritual warfare. I never let him win, but it was borderline. Yeah, I hit my knees last year. Only thing I can get out of my mouth was God. Help me God, help me and that's, that's, that's absolutely what he did. He Lifted Me Up."
" Put me up, I experienced Shalom that day and from that day on to this day Gods had everything in order."
 I try to handle it myself.
" I've always been a faithful man in the Lord, but I try to handle it myself. I was too stubborn. I was in that place where I didn't say, God could not handle this. But I was prideful man. And I do not want to think that I could not handle this by myself, by any means necessary. I got this"
" I didn't work, I hit my knees and he's Lifting me since then he's been an awesome God, he was an awesome guy before, he will be an awesome God after"
" Now, what if my doctor's appointment doesn't go as planned?"
" God already knows who results how the doctor will handle it and how the outcome will be trusting him. Y'all, I trust you."
 He is our Mighty father.
" He knows what's best and he would never lead you astray. He trusted he will. He will get you through every situation then it's your fault. I mean it this appearance of Shalom is like a hug from you, your mom, your grandma just feel calm."
" We can the knees. It's just the most beautiful thing. You vary The Spence. I hope you all experience. It, let go of it. God, give it to him. Trust him, join his seek his kingdom first and everything will be added unto. You are shooting."
 Heavenly Father.
" we come before you today, loaded loaded with heavy hearts loaded with worries, loaded with anxieties"
 from health.
 To relationships to kids to work.
 We pray that we will lose our pride.
 Realize how wonderful. Great God. You are such a great one. Forgive her father provider.
 A protector. It's their God. You willing to jump and help us on the way we have to do is admit to it.
" We have to see key first and all of these will be added to us as you please touch every person that's in here. Every person that hears this as you please continue to bless us as you always will because we are your children, you are Mighty. Father, we thank you again God for this day. It's beautiful day. Let us all rejoice in it and rejoice always. Amen."

" Invite them to come or just, you know, push them into your car and kidnap them. However we got to give people, the church will do it but we want to make sure that we're engaging with everybody. That's not familiar to us and as a church we show the love of Christ in the community so that's going to be real exciting tonight and well I just come here come back up here."
" Wesley Chapel join me in prayer here, would you? This is serious. Father, we recognize an anointing On this man's life. We recognize you're doing, work in his heart and his soul and you are using him. Holy Spirit. We sense it, we see it, we recognize it. And in Jesus name, we claim it and we support it. We thank you so much that you're doing something so cool in this man, and we believe that there are things to come that would terrify him. Should he know what?"
" Our right now. Father we pray that you would just keep working in him. We are grateful that we are a body that you have equipped so many of us to do so many different things in this body. And we don't lift up one above the other, but we just celebrate it. When we find it, you're doing great things and we trust you. Jesus Christ is in your name, we pray. Amen. So I want to pray for you again. Yeah, the best. All right."
" Okay, well, I got 1156. So we are going to break four minutes early. You get to beat the Baptist to the restaurant. Ready, set, go. You are dismissed, we love you."
"when all of a sudden,"
Sometimes.
 A tree bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy. When all of a sudden I am unaware of
 Beautiful. You are and how great your affections are for me. And
" Drawn to Redemption by the grace in his eyes. If Grace is an ocean, we're all sinking. So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss and my heart turns violently when I think"
 About the word. Yes.
" Okay. Yeah, you guys can have a seat, sit down, relax a little bit. We're going to have some announcements. Give you a little heads up. There is a lot of stuff happening at Wesley Chapel Church in the coming couple of days and weeks and"
" We just want to keep it straight, want to make sure that we're communicating and then everybody knows what's going on."
 He's real tall.
" Good wish, you know party. But to tomorrow night, I have a strategy meeting at the parsonage. Six o'clock and food will be provided. Tuesday night will be small groups at 6:30, Wednesday night, small groups, it's seven o'clock also Friday at the grill. The famous Wesley, Chapel Band, and they're starting to get around."

You have a chili just directly at the church, right? Yeah. Okay, next time. Alright next, Sunday night. Mobile church will be at Murray Lindsay's house if you need directions to get there. Just so see, mr. Josh or the preacher either one"
" Be glad to tell you how to get there. Also, May 23rd is local church conference day, okay? Alright, thank y'all."
 For what?
 Won't they?
 Eggs are eggs or something.
" Okay, we're gonna aren't you? Glad we serve a God, we can worship with joy and just as we are, are we don't have to put on a mask. We don't have to fake anything. We don't have to show up and act. A certain way we can to just come as we are and lift him up. I am so glad that our God meets us where we are. He is great. Amen."
" Men jumping up and down. If you need to let go of him and let him jump up and down, no one's going to judge. You is to let it happen. It's all right. This morning. Okay. Yes, sir."
" You join me in a word of prayer. Father, you are good and has we just sang. Each one of us. We commit to picking up the cross."
" And dying to ourselves clinging to that death, knowing that you are the one who died for us. So we lay to rest our old self, We Lay to rest our pride, We Lay to rest our own Ambitions, our own desires our own selfishness, all of our Idols will lay them down before you. Can we just say, we're going to carry the cross as you commanded us and we're going to follow you with our whole heart completely devoted all in Jesus Christ. May that be true of every single individual in this"
" Room in a new and radical way. Evermore. Father, you are so good. You are worthy of following, you are worthy of self-sacrifice, you are worthy of us, putting our whole selves on an altar before you. So made that be true. Father. We pray for all the concerns, all of the, the issues, all of the fears anxieties everything that's going on in this room, father, you know, every individual heart, you know, every individual mind, you know, every individual need every burden, every hurt, every Joy. So we put it all before."
" Or you just asking you to be the god that meets needs to be the god that comes beside us in our pain to be the guy that shows up in the joy and making life. Real father, that's what you do. Father, we pray for our community, we pray for the Lost out there car. There are people that don't know, you were on a track towards an eternity. Without you in hell lost forever. We pray that that you will send workers into the Harvest field Lord, may it be us. Amen. And amen."
" Father, we pray for our community. We pray that you heal. Some of the Brokenness of our town of our community of our friends, our neighbors, our relatives father. All of the issues with Brokenness and families Brokenness with drug addictions, Brokenness with, with impropriety and workspaces father, we pray against all the evil in this community around us. We pray against the evil in our state. We play against the evil in our country. We pray that you will build your kingdom right here in."
" This church right here in this city right here, in this county father, we pray that you will show up in a mighty way and Potter use us any way. You see, fit to make that end, come to pass, we want to see a real transform through the power of your Holy Spirit and we believe it can happen, we believe it will happen because we are going to continue to beg you until it does happen. Father, we love you so much."
" Amen. Amen. So could have the ushers come forward. We're going to continue to worship through the giving of our tithes and offerings. This is the part of the service. That should be the most Joy filled. This is where we get to say, to our father. We're getting back to you were trusting you. This is also the part of the service where we say, we believe that God has called our church to accomplish great things. And that requires a lot of resources. So we put our resources together and we go on a mission together to accomplish great things. When you put money in that offering plate, you have funding."
" The mission, you're making things possible. Like mobile Church, you're making things possible like Outreach strategies. You're making things possible like corporate worship as We Gather here. In turn the lights on in the morning. You're making that possible. So I thank you for generosity. I'm going to ask if trying to play over the offering and we will collect."
 Amen.
" A little while the the sermon is going to conclude. And we're going to bring our friend buck up here and I'm going to give everyone an opportunity that would like an opportunity to say something publicly about Buck. You can stand up and shout it from the pews. If you want, you can come up on stage and use the microphone if you want. But just want to just want to give you an opportunity. So I'll give you some time to think about that if there's anything you'd like to say to him publicly will do that at the end of the service."
" Also as was already announced, I just want to reiterate a few things from the announcements tonight. Going away party for buck a six o'clock at my house. My life that I'll provide food. Just come celebrate bucks, time here, say goodbye, bon voyage asking questions about the future tomorrow night at my house. Same time, six o'clock, I'm inviting, anybody that wants to participate in this, we're doing an Outreach strategy session. We're thinking of different ways,"
" Can reach people in our community. We had one of these, a little while ago and it changed the course of our church. It was really impactful. We really started doing the the Wesley Chapel Band. After that, we started going out and playing shows. After that meeting, we started mobile church after that. We start doing that, we committed to a few different Community engagements like the butterfly thing. The butterfly garden that we went and served at. So these Outreach meeting gives us some teeth. You know, we can sink into the community with, you know what I mean? It gets us gives us an opportunity to think strategically"
" Lee, how are we going to be effective? How we're going to reach new people for Christ? How we going to go about it? So if you're interested in that kind of stuff, you like to be tactical, you like to think strategy come to my house tomorrow night at six o'clock, be part of that conversation. We welcome any voice in the room. Those are the two. The two big ones."
" Couple days ago, I was in the car with my kids and from the back seat, I think it was re are is right here. Re wave. Hi re re just speaks up and she goes Dad. Yeah, she goes."
 Tiger sharks. Can't play the guitar.
 And they can't do stand-up comedy. And they can't make toast.
 She's right.
" She said bull sharks, can't go parachuting."
 And they can't kick box.
 Also true.
 It just struck me as bizarre like just these random facts about sharks that were very accurate.
 Who do you think?
 There are a lot of people.
 That are experts in what we're not capable of.
" It is really easy to be good at what you're not capable of, right? Like to be good at predicting, what? You're not capable of."
 I'm probably not capable of joining the NBA and becoming one of the highest-paid players in the league. Probably one step past my capability.
" Just one step, just a little one."
" Yeah, probably not capable of running for president of the United States. Have no desire. I don't think I could do that. Even if I wanted to I'm probably not capable of them."
" oh,"
" I don't know, solving some Grand math equation and we have really good at math because I'm not"
" I'm by Nature a dreamer though, right? Like it's just, it's just deep in my soul. I am always daydreaming. I'm always thinking of things that are possible. We need that that's important. Sometimes I overstep. I overstretch II saw you too far. I go, I go too much and my last church, I stood in front of the congregation and I said I'm sick and tired of thinking about how we're going to reach the next 10 people."
" Christ. I want to have a conversation about how we're going to reach the next 10,000 people for Christ. And everybody looked at me like who, he's dreaming. Big and you know what? We didn't even reach the next 10 people for Christ because it will be on our capability at the time. Well, I'm that kind of guy. I don't even I'm not going to apologize for that. I feel like every time you get up to bat swing for the fence, right? Like how many of you agree with me on this?"
" Yes, goal and try Goldberg trihard, go go and I go nuts. That's, that's just in our nature. I love it. So, so this story, this is the way today. It excites me. It strikes, a chord inside my soul and I hope it gets you excited to. That's what this message is all about today. It's about, it's about keeping that dream out getting that, that that, that I didn't think it was possible. I didn't think I was capable. I didn't think I had it in me to the surface and to go"
" Wow. Maybe that's all I want you to leave today, going, who knows? Maybe I want you to have this kind of Hope leave with this expectation, this excitement. So so here is the story. As soon as Jesus heard the news. He left in a boat to remote area to be alone. But the crowds heard that he was heading and followed on foot from many towns. Jesus saw the huge crowds as he stepped from the"
" boat and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. That evening the disciples came to him and said, this is a remote place and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to The Villages and buy food for themselves. Jesus said that isn't necessary you feed them."
 But we only have five loaves of bread and two fish.
" They answered, I'll bring them here. He said."
" Then he told the people sit down on the grass and Jesus Took Five Loaves and two fish looked up towards heaven and blessed them. Then breaking the Loaves and pieces. He gave them the breaking of the bread to the disciples to distribute to them, to the people, they all ate as much as they wanted. And afterwards, the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftovers about five thousand men were fed that day in addition to all the women and children."
" I love this story. I love this story because it is like a, just a tiny little, snapshot of this beautiful moment of that's not possible, and Jesus go and it's totally possible and then they're gone, I'm not sure if possible and the Jews. Like, boom, it just happened. It's just like this. One of them would use like I have a dream where all these people will be fed. And the disciples are like that too dumb dream, you should send them away. If they want to be fed because they're going to go by punchy's and now you do it, you will really make it happen that the real"
" We can feed them and it's gone. Okay. But maybe even a little bit, how do they feel bite bite? How are you gonna make it work? And Jesus makes it happen when I read stories like that, I think what else is possible. What else is possible? We don't need much because something incredible is possible with glitter and I get excited about that. You get excited about that."
" Good. I'm glad some of you we're excited. I'm excited. We can I get a lot of people in between us to get excited? Okay, we're gonna catch em, all. We're going to be in a form a little and those people behind you don't forget about them. We're going to get them all. Okay, so here's the thing, this story does not happen on its own, if you read the first sentence carefully at said, when Jesus heard the news,"
" Whoa, what news?"
 What news?
" John, the Baptist had just been beheaded."
" When Jesus heard the news, he got into a boat and try to head off to some secluded place."
" He heard the news that John the Baptist had just been beheaded. That changes the the the story a little bit doesn't it that sets the stage a little bit. But I feel like you can't even really capture that until you back up. Far enough to understand who John the Baptist is. So Jesus, before he was born an angel, came to Mary and said, you're going to be with child. The holy spirit is going to come upon you and it's going to be born of the spirit and can be Immaculate concise going to be an amazing thing. God,"
" Going to live among his people. This is incredible. But before that even happened, an angel showed up to a man named Zechariah and said, you're going to have a son even in your old age. Your wife's going to give birth to someone, you're going to name him John, and he's going to go before the Messiah, and he's going to tell the world prepare yourselves for the coming of Jesus. He's going to make the road straight and you can make the path. Clear. He's going to get, everyone's heart ready to hear what the Messiah has to say it."
 Got one of the most important jobs in history.
" John had a big role to play, and it says, Elizabeth John's mother was actually Mary's cousin, so Jesus and John, the Baptist were second cousins. They would have grown up and known each other. They're about the same age. They would have been closed. They probably would have been really good friends. Both of their births were foretold by an Angel. It had so much in common, right? John starts his ministry."
" In the wilderness and people are going out to see him and large numbers, John would have been an absolute celebrity. Everybody would have been talking about John, the Baptist. Everybody would have been going to hear John the Baptist preached. Everybody would have been so curious about this crazy man wearing these bizarre clothes eating this bizarre food, living completely countercultural. Just an absolute Rebel out there but he's also speaking truth and people are drawn to him and he's looking at people like the King Herod. He's looking at power and authority."
" He structures and he's looking at people in charge and he's looking at very, very strong man. And he's saying what you're doing is wrong and you've got to change your life and he's speaking truth to power and that takes courage at takes conviction that takes character and John's got it. And he speaks truth to the wrong man at the wrong time."
" And that man Herod who hears him call out as Sin. So publicly says, I've had enough of this John fella and he takes John and he throws John into prison."
 John even appeals to Christ at one point.
 Aren't you the Messiah who was to come?
" John sitting in prison wondering, if Jesus is who he says, he is John sitting in prison going. I thought the Messiah would spoil us from the prisons."
" Jesus says, yeah, I am."
 But then answers him no more. We're not going to talk about your incarceration.
" In fact, that's where it's going to end for John. John is beheaded."
" Make it even deeper, some of Jesus disciples were actually John's disciples before they started following Jesus Christ. So, son of Jesus core team. His closest friends would have been John's closest friends, too."
" So when they heard the news, when John heard that, when the disciples heard the news, when Jesus heard the news, it would have hit like a ton of bricks, you've all lost people. You care about?"
" You've all lost people. You care about? You know what it feels like to get that phone call or to hear that doctor say you've been in the room, maybe, you know what it's like, you know what? It's like, John would have been 30 32 years, old 33 years old, maybe"
 Younger than me.
" And it wasn't just this. Okay. So, to sort of story of Jesus feeding the 5,000. It's an incredible Miracle when you get so excited about it, but but it starts, it starts a little bit before that Miracle takes place. You see. Jesus is teaching and one spot and his kind of camped out there and thousands of people are coming to hear him and to be healed by him and to learn his his parables in the winter, his teachings, and they're coming to understand him and"
" Really popular and he's really on a high, right? Like he's exhausted anybody who's done Ministry or any kind of big public work like that, you know that it's exhausting. It's tiring after I preach on Sunday as I usually am about. Hmm, completely useless till 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon after I've taken a little bit of a nap, right? It's just exhausting, so you got to imagine, Jesus is tired. Just from the everyday. We're going to ruin of doing Ministry out in the wilderness out, in the open air and and he had just sent his 12 disciples."
" On a mission. He sent them off to buy to you. Go to that town, preach the gospel. You rid of that town, preach the gospel, you would have that town, you live in that town, you rid of that town and he sends his disciples out all over the area and says and that you do ministry and that you Healing The Sick, I want you giving sight to the Blind and are you casting out demons and I want you to preach the good news of the Gospel that going on. They're doing incredible things and they're coming back. They're coming back. If you ever done the mission trip, you know, that's exhausting, that's exhausting."
" You can live in the vacation and you thought as soon as you got home, I need a vacation. You know, you have feelings when you come in for a long trip and just like, why didn't I plan on not going back to work for three more days because I'm so tired. They come home from this trip and meet back up with Jesus. They're high from the the the win right there. Excited. That Jesus male demons with fluttering. Out of people, people are getting healed, people were getting sick."
" Hey, people are believing in the message. This was the most incredible trip I've taken but I imagine they like, and I'm tired. Holy smoke, there's a lot of need out there. Holy smokes, these people will suck the life out of you. If you let them I'm exhausted."
" All coming back together and their trips are all ending. In Jesus has these thousands and thousands of people with him. He gets that means like a bombshell. Oh, by the way,"
" John your friend, the man who baptized you, your cousin, the one who, dedicated his life to making your ministry work. The one who took some of your disciples under his wing and trade them, how to be disciples first."
 John.
 He was just beheaded.
" You want to talk about? A can't do moment. Jesus looks at a crowd of 5,000 people and says feed them. If I were in his disciples crowd I would say, I can't because I'm too dang tired, and the other day."
" I want to go cry. I just lost my friend. I just watched John. He was an amazing, man."
" Eyes people, they don't care. They just want to see Americorps get healed. They don't"
" So Jesus says come here fellas, it's getting this boat. Well, we'll go, we'll roll away, we'll take a break from all these people and they're rolling, and they're out floating around, but the Bible says the crowd. Figured it out. They had charted. The disciples course, they charted. Jesus course, and ran ahead on foot along the shore and got to A Jesus boat, was going to land in this secluded place."
" Great. Can you feel that they would have felt right now? Can you put yourself in their situation? They're like, oh good. I'm so tired. A weekend retreat, sounds like heaven. This is going to be so nice, just move Jesus. A couple of people I trust and like except for that guy Judas and I know but we just ask man, just as on the beach just taking a little picnic just just getting away from it all and and and"
" They don't even know their boat on Shore and there's already a couple thousand people in from the boot. Jesus, Remember When you calmed the storm can you make one? Come back up? Jesus, maybe a current could get us. Maybe a fish. Could swallow me. I don't care. Can you just get me out of here? Jesus says. All right and the boat on Shore says he had compassion."
" The crowd. One of the Gospel says for, they were like sheep without a shepherd."
" He saw this group of people and he said I love him too much, I love him too much and that's our savior, that's the difference between him and me because honestly, Wesley Chapel, I get to exhausted, I don't care what you're going through. I'm probably going to be a lousy Pastor because I'm human, right? Like if I'm, if I'm too tired at, I'm going to cancel that event because I'm a stinker. And I care about myself, that's just selfish nature of me, but Jesus Christ, never will do that to you. Jesus Christ will never see."
" Crowd and turned his back. Jesus Christ will never allow exhaustion, or his own Humanity. His own hurt, his own pain, get in the way of showing you compassion and showing you love, Jesus, preaches, that boat on Shore and he says, I'm going to start teaching them. And I'm going to start healing their sick because I love these people and this is why I came"
" And he just plowed through it, he just plowed through the pain plow through the hurt plowed through the exhaustion. Now, if you continue reading the story, and by the way, this story is recorded in all four gospels is the only Miracle that's actually recorded in all four of the gospels, that should wave a flag. This is an important one. This is a big deal Miracle. This is an exciting Miracle. We see right after this event. Jesus does push off again, and go get some actual"
" Rest with his disciples. There's a rhythm to life. Work, rest work, rest work, rest."
" God's pattern for human life isn't when things get tough, quit. And it isn't when things get tough, you just keep working, working working working because that's a disaster recipe. God's rhythm in life is when things get tough, take a rest and then get back to it."
" When things get hard, it's okay to take a rest and then you don't quit. You keep going rest, not quit. That's the that's the, that's the key. Okay. So, so Jesus gets answers, teaching them. And now they are intentionally in a secluded Place intentionally far from civilization intentionally it with more. All the people would normally be"
 But they're unintentionally surrounded by a crowd of several thousand people.
" And his disciples are watching Jesus teach and they're and they're listening to Jesus teaching and they're looking at the crowd and they're looking at their watches and are looking at the crowd and looking at Jesus and he's still going still teaching on shut up so these people can go home. Come on let's wrap this up. I've ever been listening to me, preach at like 12 or two and you're like Pastor it's 1202. So let's turn and then and then and then it might already you've ever gotten there."
" Because that's what's going through my head is about 1202, whenever I'm preaching. By the way, I'm going to shut up, Scott, shut up, Scott your overtime. You can imagine what that feeling at this time because Jesus has all these people in the middle of nowhere."
 And they're about to undergo a logistical nightmare.
 Hey Jesus. It's feeding time for the cattle and they're about to get real ornery unless we do something about it.
" People get cranky, don't they? What's the word hangry? When you're hungry and angry?"
 Shut up.
 Okay.
" What after you for a loop? Um,"
" We get we get there, it's just human nature and the disciples know this. I mean looking at this crowd, another can have their own little lunchboxes. Going many people, my food, I'm hungry too. You know like this was supposed to be my time off but hey what are these people doing here? And you look at his Jesus, send them away so they can go buy food in the nearby Villages. Yeah, it's 5:30 6 o'clock. It's going to take them a while to get there on foot. They're going to be"
" So exhausted, they're going to need some food, just send them away. So you can, they don't turn on us. I don't get mob beaten because we don't have any food for them, because we LED them all out here. I don't want to be held responsible for this. Jesus says that's not necessary. He wants to do something big."
" You want to do something big and and the disciples? A pretty sure it is necessary. Yeah, you can sense the tension."
" Jesus. You feed them, you give them something to eat and in one of the Gospels it says that'll take like a couple years wager like 20 years wages to feed all these people like you really want to. I mean that will empty the account. We have to make the mortgage the building to do that. Really? How are we going to possibly feed all these people? That's insane. That's a big measure. What if I told you? We're going to pick up the food tab for all of Green County for the next six months."
" Wesley Chapel, we're going to do it. We're going to pay for everyone's food for the next thing. You'd look at me like, okay, okay. I didn't like doing the Pastoral search but I suppose we could do another one. It wasn't that hard. There's other good candidates out there."
" And I because that's crazy, right, who? And you never feel like such a waste to right? Okay. What happens to their field once they eat it?"
 Some of you just got that.
" That's what you want to do, with all of our money right now. That's what you want to do. All the resources we have. You want to just"
" Somebody just say flush, it is that he couldn't have. That could you have Jesus as you come something? They said, well, here's the deal. We've got these Five Loaves to fish,"
" And one of the Gospel says, that's not even enough for everyone, have a single bite."
" We can't we can't do it just like, this is what you got there. What do you got there? What do you got to remind me of a story in the Old Testament? Does the guy named Moses? This is an incredible story. God's people are enslaved by the superpower of the world. At the time, the Egyptians were the strongest force, the strongest military force, the mightiest Nation, they had the biggest empire. They had the most amazing architecture, the Egyptians were it right powerful dynasties year after year, generation after generation, and that enslaved."
" Israelite people. And there are about 400,000 men that were enslaved and and I mean right now the United States probably most powerful Nation on the earth without a doubt, right? I we are the superpower of the world Egypt would have been the superpower of their time. Now imagine we have some great amazing abundance surplus of I don't know wheat or something and some other nations had you're going to have to give us that wheat. We'd say no you can't have it and we're going to come take it by force. I dare you to try"
" Hi, because we're the United States. We will squash you like a bug. That's how that would go, right?"
" God looks at Moses in says, go to Egypt and tell them let my people go."
" No. Is this because I can't. What do you think? This is going to be? Are you kidding me? God. And and he probably had a stutter, he's probably. Oh God. If I tell them what my people go, they're going to make fun of me. Yeah, and that asks him, what do you got there? Right in your hand? What do you got there? What do you got there? Moses. And Moses is like,"
" I got a stick. Okay, we'll use your stick, we use your stick and man at one point. God stretch has Moses stretch out of staff and the Red Sea parts and the Israelites walk across on dry land and Egyptians father. And he stretches out and the Sea closes back in and kills the entire Egyptian Army. What do you got there? Moses stick. Okay."
" I can work with that, are you sure? This is the stick, it's a nice stick but it's a stick. I can work with that. I can, I can use that stick to defeat the Egyptian Army."
 Imagine holding a stick and God saying you can take on the Marine Corps with that stick.
" Are you sure with this stick got some Kappa disciples, what do you have? A few pieces of bread and a couple of fish? Oh, okay, I can work with that. God saying, I can work with that. If you'll put that in my hands, I can work with that."
 What do you have?
" Meager resources, I can work with that. What do you have? Just a little bit? I can work with that."
" If you're willing and faithful to put that in my hands, I can work with that. He divides the Loaves and Fishes and you know the story the rest is history, right? All the people are fed and all the people are satisfied, five thousand men plus women and children. They go home with full bellies."
 There's twelve basketfuls left over.
" Fitting right, God meets. All the needs of the people but takes care of his workers as well."
" Oh man, Wesley Chapel, we don't have much."
" We don't have much other, get our finances. What barely getting by, or keeping our head above water. We're paying the bills, but we can't afford to do a lot of the dreams that I have in my head, right? We can't afford to go after things, the way I want to go after them or not, they're financially. But, you know, something we as a church, put ourselves in God's hands and say, whatever we have is not ours. It is God's."
" You know, his responses."
" I can work with that, I can work with that. If we're willing to say, I'll put my time in God's hands, he can say, I'll work with that. I'll put my faith in God's hands. I'll put my resources in, God's hands, whatever it is, I'll put it in God's hands, he can work with that if you can take a couple days and a couple of fishes and feed 5,000 people, imagine what he can do here. If he can take a stick and beat down the world superpower with it, imagine that he can do here."
 Imagine what he can do with you. What are your Loaves and Fishes?
 What is God asking you to just put in his hands and trust him with it and say God can work with it?
" Because God's response is going to be I can work with that. If you just put it in my hands maybe God's calling you to do something and you're saying no, no I'm not a people person. I don't like dealing with that. I can't speak in front of people. I can't play in front of people. I can't share my faith with people if you want to save your life but I'll try, I'll give God whatever little Loaves and Fishes. I have God's going to look and say. I can work with that, and we're going to see people come to Christ for your work."
" I want a fun, great things, great products from the church to pay for this trip or that trips. I want to make sure that we can afford this Earth. Hold that and simple, but I only have a little bit. I don't know if I can afford to really do anything to make a big enough dent. I don't know if I can. I got something I can work with that."
 I can work with that.
" I'm saying I can't, I'm scared, I'm insecure, I'm not wealthy, I'm not educated, I'm not talented."
 Sinful.
" I'm not holy enough. I'm not good enough. I'm not godly enough, you know, something God is in the business of taking little itty-bitty bits and saying I can work with that. It's our job to put our lives on an altar before him and say, you can have what I got, and you can do anything you want with what I got."
" Man, sky's the limit. Sky is the limit."
" Your dream with me a little bit cut, kind of Julie for a little bit, right? We're doing something that's stupid. Simple as a church right now. Mobile Church, you got you this concept mobile church, right? Okay. God, we have a PA system. Now, that that's fairly mobile and we can go and we can preach in different places in different communities, and different houses and we can try to reach neighbors and we can try to make sure that we're including everybody who's been shut down for so long. We can we can do that."
" Think God is saying to our church. I can work with that. I can work with that and we're pretty church and neighborhoods. I told a handful of other pastors. What we're doing here at Wesley, Chapel with his mobile church, and they lit up, and they got so excited and their time, we're going to have to do to make that work in our church. But who knows what's going to happen? Who knows that's going to unfold from? I have no idea what this is gonna go, you know, that the district superintendents. He's probably gonna come"
" Next one, our next mobile church because he wants to witness firsthand, what we're up to. We don't have hardly anything. Wesley Chapel. Our church is essentially broke. We've got dwindling numbers compared to you know, where they should be where he probably would have three years ago. Four years ago, five years ago, things are kind of turnaround. I'm no doubt about them, not worried about that at all, but when putting ourselves in God's hand and God is saying I can work with that."
" Get excited. I'm thrilled looking at the future because of stories like this Loaves and Fishes, I think we're in a season, we've got to ignore some exhaustion for a while. We got to push through some pain and some frustration and some some failure, maybe we've got to push through some bad ideas. We got to push through some stuff, we got to stick our shoulder to the plow, keep our nose to the grindstone, but I believe God saying, I can work with that. Wesley Chapel, I can work with that. I can do something. If you keep added. If you don't quit, if you keep moving. If you"
 First we need to rest and then get back at it. I can work with that man. I am super excited. What's going on in your life?
 What are your moves and Fishes? Where are you just begging to have to say I can live with that if you put that on an altar before him.
" That's we also are getting this and our own personal lives and you get it corporately as a church, you guys sky's the limit. Who knows what God's capable of, who knows what we'll see, who knows what's going to happen. And how many thousands of people were going to see come to Christ as a result who knows?"
" I will pray. Then we're going to switch gears, father."
 You have always been the God who makes the impossible possible. You've always been a God who takes very little and does very great things.
 I pray that you will keep doing your wonders.
" Father, would you give each and every one of us a sense that the possible and the impossible or just words in our minds?"
" Everything you want to happen. Can happen. And that you can use this to accomplish things. We never even dreamed of Father, we believe in you that much. We believe in your spirits power. We believe you are a God who wants to work, we love you. Jesus Christ."
" Father, we pray your blessing on this church, and on each individual in this room, Jesus name we pray. Amen. If I could have my friend, mr. Buck Phillips. Come on up."
" Okay, I know this is gonna be awkward for buck cuz he doesn't like to be the center of attention but I don't care. We're doing it anyways."
" The floor is now open. I would love for anybody who would like to say anything to Buck about his time here, what he's meant to them. How you've I don't know, always been attracted to him but now whatever you need to say,"
 All right.
" All right. Now,"
" He is a young man. Okay. All right. How old are you books? 21, 21 years old. Alright, these young man is going overseas to another country. I mean amazing. Amazing, this young man."
 He'd been here for what?
" I'm up here and look at the people that has you know falling in love with this guy. You can't help it. This young man is just lovable blessing but he's going somewhere away to another land that they hardly speak English, whatever like that, but they're going to love him. Yeah, this group of people is going to love this guy and when he comes back he's probably gonna"
" Married. No, but this young man, when he comes back, he's going to be a different person. He's still going to look the same, but he's going to be a different person because he's going to be grown. I mean he may be 22 years old when they actually him again. But you can't be grown. He's going to be a grown man and we started calling each other which cast in the Sundance Kid, okay? But when I saw him that instantly hit,"
" Me. Okay, all right if you ever saw the movie Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid. All right, the two of them up on the cliff over the river. No one looks to the other one says, let's jump. They haven't said, I can't swim, it's it. Well, the fall alone will kill you, but all of a sudden both of them just grabbed each other and takes off the jumps."
" So I want you, when you go over there, take a little part of me with you buddy, okay? Because we're going to survive."
 We're glad you were tired and still get excited.
 Where you going?
" Ted, he's not very good at answering the questions about money because he's very modest. He would have only done all this fundraising before. He actually started working with us at Wesley Chapel, he was delayed from going to Zambia because of the pandemic, but what we are going to do, I put in offering plate out, we are going to put that out. If anybody wants to give two bucks Ministry to support him, going forward, just throw some money into that offering plate right there. Marked for buck very to Wesley Chapel, I'm going to let him"
" Checks that we don't have to give them a bunch of different checks and all that to deal with. So if you want to pass it on, you wouldn't welcome to. But we want to make sure that we are supporting you financially that we're supporting you in prayer, and that you are on our on our hearts and Minds. As you go, you carry us with you. We love you."
" angry with you and when you come back to visit or come back to State, you know, you're going to come back to clear family"
 like I'm yeah go ahead and the other
 Any other words?
" Okay, if I'm going to, I'm going to wrap it up now. But if anybody wants to say more, he's not leaving till tomorrow morning. So you can call them all hours of the night two or three in the morning, just give them a call. Just tell him how you feel. But seriously at six o'clock at my house, we are going to have a going away party. So come to the party and you can pull them aside then and say something to him but Brock Brock. As you get out of your not done yet. Come here. I'm wrapping it up but you got to stay."
" Here wrap with me, brother. I am. Okay. So a little little back story on Buck. I had the absolute honor and privilege of being his youth pastor. When he was a middle schooler a, he was actually shorter at one point in his life, he's like this. He's like, he's like he was, he was Chloe's age."
" Buck was close age when I met him and as his youth pastor every once in a while, you just get a kid that will come along and you just see so much potential in them and you see so much ability and you just see God's hand and God's anointing on their life and you think holy smokes, I want to put a tracker chip in this kid's ear and follow him for the rest of his life and see what God does with him. Just so I can be in all of God's amazing work and I've said that, I can't tell you how many times."
" About you that, I just want to track your movements through life, not in a creepy way, but his ability to absorb scripture and, and to memorize it, this kid, could quote, you wordperfect any verse in the Book of John in the Book of Luke and 1st or 2nd Corinthians. I remember what all books we actually memorized but this kid so much of the word of God in his heart and Bible says, the word of God is not return void and his hunger for"
" Knowledge and understanding and ability to lead and serve his humility, his kid would do anything. You asked him to do for the sake of Christ, it came here. And as his pastor, we kind of had like a mentor-mentee relationship but it's almost been flipped on its head. A few times where Buck is the master and I'm the student so many times because he's so brilliant and so insightful and just understand scripture so well,"
" and we love you think one last word of advice, just pastoral I care about you."
" When you're in Zambia, watch out for hippos."
" They're very aggressive. They have giant mouths there. Faster than they look, we come here. We're going to pray for you. Father. Would you guys join me in prayer?"
 Your anointing is. So clearly on bucks life.
" Anybody who knows? Him has no doubt that you have amazing plans in store for Him. Father, we recognize that life is going to be a crucible at times, that there are going to be difficulties ahead, that there are going to be hard times to go through and hurts and pains to suffer. We pray, your grace, and your mercy, and your presence through all of those father, we recognize that they're going to be victories ahead, they're going to be winds, father, you're going to use him to accomplish things that he has new have it."
" Idea about, we pray for humility and joy during those times."
" Father, we pray for your protection, your hand on his life piece for his mother for her. We pray for it all."
 We love you. We thank you so much that we got to have this journey with buck for this season in our church and father may we recognize that as a church today we are not sending goodbye and losing a friend. We are launching a warrior to take ground for the kingdom and it's in Jesus name. We pray all these things. Amen. I love you buddy.
" Okay, you are dismissed."
"Change the change, the change, wandering comes tumbling in like a prodigal child. See the water. Start crumbling that the Gates of Glory open wide."
You can have a seat.
 We are going to have some announcements now.
" I love music these guys Friday night. He wasn't there, you miss something. These guys put in a show I've heard people sing I've heard a lot of people play music but these guys put on a show that was a lot of clapping as a lot of people. Bragging lot of people commending, the ways that they performed Friday night, you get a chance you need"
" To go see these guys. I mean, they put on a show up here. Yes, but they really do put on a show when they get out in public. All right, today after church informational meeting about the Youth mission trip tonight. Mobile church, is it Marie Lindsay's house at six o'clock. This is Josh's mom, if you need directions, you know, just see him after church."

Next Sunday, not this Sunday, but Nick funding that dress, all right. That's a mobile church will be at Jonathan and carry humans house and Union point. I don't know exactly where that's at myself so we may want to see passes."
 Exactly where that's at. It's right next door to their neighbors.
 Their house.
 Yeah.
 Come see our hearts.
 Sweep place with hope like wildfire around our very Souls Spirit come and very done.
" There, sir."
" Let's go to the Lord in a word of prayer. Father, You Are, Holy you are good, you are right. And all your ways we adore. You we love you. Jesus Christ, we pray that your spirit will continue to just fill this place that we will continue this heart and atmosphere of joyous worship just celebrating how good you are. How wonderful it is that"
" Been saved by you. How wonderful the grace is. That we are just swimming in. Father, I pray for all of the concerns and burdens and all that kind of stuff. Vitamin. We just bring it here today and put it on an altar and then just leave it there. Father knowing that you take care of us that you're a God. Who meets your people where they are and Carries our burdens for us. Father, we pray for our community as we tackle, all these different kinds of Outreach strategies and think of all these different kinds of ways of reaching new people, may you bless our efforts father's. We look at things like mobile church tonight. I pray that that will go just so"
" So well and and will do a great job representing you in the neighborhood. Father, bringing the church into the neighborhood where it belongs. You are good and we love you. We trust you. We are your people. We put ourselves in your hands and we continue to pray. We love you, amen. If I could have our Usher's come forward right quick, we're going to continue to worship through the receiving of ties and offerings. This is our opportunity to celebrate what God has done and to give"
" Back to him and an act of trust in an act of worship. Bible says, God loves a cheerful Giver gives, no compulsion. So, don't feel like anyone's twisting any arms here. We just love you, and this is how we fund our mission. This is how we make the church, go forward and keep paying all of our bills and make sure that we're able to keep reaching out to lost people. So, I'm gonna ask you, if you would pray over the offering sir."
" Oh, well well, good morning. Good morning. Good morning. How are you feeling this morning?"
 Good.
 Awake.
" I'm awake to Alive, alert awake and enthusiastic. So what?"
" I am, I am far from home. All right, side note, before we get started, I just gotta say, I did something funky to my back and every time I turn funny, or, you know, whatever little awkward movement, if I winced in pain, I'm not reflecting anything on you. That's me. That's internal. That's just happening. So just ignore me. Call me a baby, a sissy, whatever you want. Just know that. That's what's going on there. So don't don't think too much of it, you what?"
" Getting old now I'm here. I hear. I hear it gets a lot better as I get older, right?"
" 35 via 35. 35, I'm 35 feel like 35 is 235, is too."
 I'm not 35.
 I'm 34.
 You have one job in this marriage.
 And it's to remember my age.
" Okay. Careful, careful, careful, careful."
" Okay, I'm taking this off."
" Can you hear me? Okay, if I use this one, it's almost louder. Isn't it?"
 Can't see if I got it all or not.
 I will now post your cell phones to really catch me in that one. Are you?
 I got this. I got this. I watched a video on YouTube.
 I don't do this in a sink.
 Anybody up for a shave? I have real steady hands.
 Your head. That what we're looking at. Bring that cue ball over here. I'm gonna get him.
" can't shave the Contours of a smile now, can I"
 Shut up.
 How many of you got a round of applause? Last time you shaved? Huh.
 Is that better? Am I all clean?
" Okay, can you hear me now? Okay, still."
 Cuz I forgot this morning and I was running late and I wanted to just do it now.
" now, this"
" Terrible time to shave your face, Pastor. All right. So why am I shaving? My fate? Why did I just shave? My, why did I shave my face in front of everybody? Two reasons. And the first one is kind of vain. I am super proud that I can do that. How many fellas fellas shave with a straight razor? How many of you say with a straight razor still?"
" Okay, when we moved here. So, this is fairly new for me. When we moved here, I was just curious about it. I've always seen it on TV and it looks so manly, you know what I'm talking about? Like like you watch it on TV and you see those guys with like the the knife or whatever they're like on a battlefield and like that was like whoa there's a real man or even see like the Professional Barber and you're like men you admire the skill and this craftsmanship of a, how they handle themselves."
" A tools, I guess that's neat. And so I did what, any young Millennial would do. I watched a million YouTube videos on how to do it and then I ordered one from Amazon and it showed up in the mail and I got myself a razor. And then I cut my face about 30 times the first time I shaved, and I bled all over the bathroom and my shirts and I bled all over everything and then I said, okay, that's probably not right. Maybe need to sharpen the razor some more. So I got those big fat, leather straps, you know, the kid beaten kind and"
" I shaved order the eye. What's that? What sharpening? I sharpened it and I try it again. I cut myself another 30 or so times and so I actually switched to a different kind of Razor that has disposable blades built right into the straight edge. So now I use disposable straight edges. I'm not, it's kind of like it's like cheating. That's like not all the way there, right? If not, I'm not like a purist, I'm not super traditional but I could skip the leather part the leather belt part, then I shaved again, and I cut myself some more. I watched the more YouTube videos. I, she had began"
" I cut myself a few more times she began shaped again. She again, this is over the course of several weeks because I really only have to shave about once a week. Because back to that, not being much of a man thing, I just can't grow it. Like a real man, I tell her I look in the mirror I'm like, can't you grow a beard? Come on. And then nothing happens. I look like a 16 year old, who's trying too hard. You know what I mean? It is so depressing, but at the same time, but once a week, I get in front of the mirror and I shave and, and, and before I knew it,"
" I could do it with two or three Cuts. I got it down to where I was only bleeding a little bit, right? And then after, you know, a few more weeks, few more weeks, few more weeks. Keep shaving keep shaving, keep shaving practice on the dog, you know, whatever it took, I got down. I'm kidding about the dog. By the way, I got down to where I could shave my face without cutting myself anymore."
 The Habit.
 Formed me.
 I formed a habit and then the Habit formed me.
" I formed a habit in the habit. Formed me. I hope you remember that line because that is pivotal for today. This is so important I developed a skill with intention over time and before I knew it, the skill had set in so deep that I'm confident enough to just shave my face in front of a crowd of people will even have a little bit of nerves coursing through. And my hands are a little shakier than normal. I think, you know what, my hands have enough muscle memory in them. I'm"
" Enough. I could probably do this in front of a whole crowd of people without even cutting my face. And I say that right now, I haven't even checked if I'm bleeding anywhere and I but but but but I can do it. Now I can do, I don't do it out, looking at homes, do in the shower, not even looking in the mirror because I've Got the Feeling down because the Habit has shaped me so much that that I just know how it's supposed to feel. I know how it's supposed to go. I know what it's supposed to sound. Like I know what it's supposed to look like, I know. Yeah, I got it."
 Time.
 Habit habits.
 R.
 Probably the most important aspect of our faith walk.
" And we miss that, I missed that, I missed that for a long, long time. I didn't have that rooted deep enough into me. My personal walk with Christ felt much like a roller coaster and a lot of you can identify. There were times where I felt super close to Christ there were times where I felt distant, there were times where I was reading. My Bible, all night, I would stay up all night and pray and"
" Study scripture, and I wouldn't get any sleep at. I go to work the next day, whatever. I would just hit hard. I didn't care. I was so passionate and then I would go months without even opening the word of God, without even praying."
 I didn't have habits.
" Habits form us, we form our habits, and then our habits form us. Let me read a passage of scripture for today, because this is so so important."
 Now.
" Fear the lord and serve him with all faithfulness, throw away, the gods of your ancestors, they worshipped before beyond the Euphrates river and in Egypt and serve the Lord."
" But if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day, whom you will serve whether the gods of your ancestors."
" Whom they serve beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord."
" The Familiar pass if you know you've heard this, I love this passage one because as a father in a man that's something you build your home on. That's something you build your family. That's some foundational piece. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. It's not a question. My kids don't wake up and get to choice if they're going to go to church or not."
" Because they're in my house. They're coming. I don't care. If you don't get dressed, you're going in your jammies. You're going. It's going to happen like it."
 Me and my house one day my kids have to make the decision. They'll have to choose. They'll have to decide if they want to follow Christ or not they'll have to become their own walk. It will have to become their own walk. But right now while they're under my house under my authority
" We will serve the Lord. So I spent a lot of time thinking about that. We will serve the Lord, we will serve the Lord. That's kind of the the main point of this. Let me give you a little bit of background on the passage and then we're going to unpack that sentence. We will serve the Lord because that is so pivotal to our walk. First of all, this comes at a very special time and Israelites history. And it's delivered by a very special man who led the Israelites."
" The Israelites had just come out of slavery and they had just left Egypt. And a lot of you know the stories there's been a lot of great movies made the Israelites come out of slavery and they cross the Wilderness and they get to the edge of the promised land and they look in but they see Giants and they're afraid and I tell God what are you trying to do? Kill us and God says, fine, I've had enough with you, you're going to wander the Wilderness for 40 years until everybody who was too cowardly."
" Cowardly to go in the promised land dies off and I'll raise up the Next Generation to take what I promised your ancestors. And so God takes his people back to the edge of the promised land, and he tells Moses because of something that went wrong along the way. You don't get to go into the promised land. Joshua son of nun, your Protege, your Apprentice. He's going to lead the people and so Moses goes off and dies."
" And the Israelites begin. One of the greatest conquests in human history. They take over the land of Canaan, the promised land, and they go in, on this massive, military assault with millions and millions of people and millions of soldiers. And they take all these different territories in the promised land and, and Joshua was leading them. And Joshua was fierce and Joshua was a warrior and Joshua was a Godly Man, Joshua had a tough job."
 It's hard to follow a legend.
" To be the the second leader of somebody who was really, really great to follow somebody. Who was really, really great. Can you imagine you're hearing Moses, say Joshua, you're going to take my staff and lead on into the future and you're like, what you parted the Red Sea you called down Manna From Heaven, you spoke to a rock and water gushed out. You saw the ten plagues."
" Destroy the superpower of the world at the time. What do you mean? I got to take your shoes. I got to run in your footsteps. I got to try to be the second after that. Usually, that guy gets steamrolled and sacrificed, right? And then the next guy can actually lead. That's usually how it goes, right. Oh, um, who's the, the coach and the player in the football game."
" Help me out here. Your football guy, right? Tom, Tom. Brady, he's pretty good, right? As far as the ball goes and throwing the ball and his coach,"
" No, not that guy. I don't care who he's with now. The guy he was with"
" Belichick. Okay. That was like a match made in heaven, right? Belichick and Brady. How many Super Bowls did they win together?"
" Like all of them. What? Six six or seven. Okay, it was the Colts."
" I'm really into sports you know, Patriots. Okay. Sorry, cool."
 Patriots.
 Can you imagine being the next head coach of the Patriots? After that Legacy that Belichick left?
" Oh, I don't want to be that coach, right? I said so you've got Joshua trying to lead the people in. I shouldn't use examples where I know nothing about them, right. Okay. So you've got Joshua trying to lead these people into the promised land and Joshua will comes out on top. He's radically successful. They conquer almost all of the promised land. They set people up, they divvy up the land, they bring the promise to fruition. They realize the vision of a land flowing with milk and honey."
" They bring the people home, they established the nation, they've got it all set up. Joshua did what he was called to do he finished? Well,"
 And now Joshua is at the end of his life and the Bible records. He's a hundred and ten years old and he's addressing the people. When you read this passage I've always pictured like this this very you know you like just the strong you know middle-aged just just this this massive man going to serve God or serve Idols choose today whom you will serve as for me and my house. We will serve it.
 Picture that.
" But what really happened was a hundred and ten year old man, stood up to address the crowd."
 Picture that. It's a little different.
" And and chapter 24 of the Book of Joshua records, this speech. And he says, do you remember"
" Do you remember Abraham was living in a Land of idol, worshippers their patterns, their habits had formed them, they worshipped Idols, they didn't know God at all, but God chose Abraham, God called him out, God decided he wanted a relationship with him, God broke the pattern, broke the habits, broke the chains of bondage that the idolatry had created and called Abraham to A Whole New Life."
" And over time they become enslaved and you know something slavery causes habits slavery causes patterns slavery you don't get to choose you know your formed by your environment and slavery had kind of shape the nation of Israel and and then God chose them and said I want them out. I love them and God intervene and God broke through and God brought them out of slavery with a mighty mighty hand. And Joshua said, you remember the plagues you remember the Red Sea, remember how it covered the Egyptian?"
 Army. You remember how he led us through the desert? Do you remember the food? You remember the Miracles? You remember the water? Do you remember the conquest? You remember how God drove out our enemies before us? You remember how we got to where we are?
" Then he says, throw away your idols. And this is the most heartbreaking thing to me. The fact that they got through everything that Joshua just described and still held onto idols."
" A hundred ten years old. Josh was going, you still have a problem with idolatry?"
 Cleanse the land. Get rid of your Idols worship and serve God only.
" And he stops and looks at the people. And he says, but I'll tell you something, you need to make a decision. If you look at God and you see something undesirable, if you look at God and you don't see something beautiful, if you want something else, that's okay. Pick something else. If you want your Idols, if you'd rather have the gods of your, your ancestors who were lost in their in their own Wilderness, if you'd rather have the gods of the people whom God just smited if you'd rather have their gods. If"
 Rather have any of this nonsense around you choose today whom you will serve.
" You're going to serve something, is the underlying message right there. You're going to serve something."
" The human heart is a factory for Idols. Can't remember which Theologian wrote that down, but that's great, theology. The human heart is a factory for Idols, you're going to serve something, you're going to serve something. You're going to make yourself a God, you're going to make your job, a God. You're going to make your spouse, the love relationships in your life. I'll God, you're going to make your children of God, you're going to make your career. 'god you're going to make something into a god."
" Choose today, whom you will serve. That's what Joshua said to him and then he makes this incredible statement. But as for me,"
" In my house, we will serve the Lord all of you thority and the ferocity that a hundred and ten year old speaks over his own family."
" Grandparents, speak it out loud great-grandparents. Speak it out loud. I love what Joshua does. He claims it for his family? We will serve the Lord. I will exercise whatever influence. I have over my household and we will serve the Lord."
 What does it mean to serve the Lord?
 What does it mean to serve the Lord II just started?
 Searching through all these different scriptures and I started thinking a lot about it.
 It's a
 It's a unique word in the placement in the sentence is unique. We will serve. It's not we have served or we're going to serve some day. We're going to serve or it's not an event. It's a never going process. Our life is going to reflect service and the indication there is Habitual.
 The indication there is habit.
 And God actually prescribed habits into their lives and I'm going to unpack some of them but let me just talk through getting with my notes. I'm just going to talk through it.
" There were a handful of habits that they were to do to demonstrate their service to the Lord and then there's habits that Jesus prescribes for us to demonstrate our service to him to Jesus Christ. So first one, and this one is beautiful, this is a great Habit to get into sabbath-keeping."
 Sabbath. Keeping.
" Now, like I said, you're going to make an idol."
 Sabbath. Keeping.
 Destroys the idol of work and busyness and feeling like you're in charge of everything when Sabbath comes.
" You hang everything up and you say the world spins on without me I trust that God's got it under control and I don't have to work on it for a day. Once a week, every week, work, work, work work, work, work, rest."
" Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work, rest."
 This was a habit that God prescribed to his people.
 You don't buy and sell you don't.
" Cook, you don't worry about cleaning, you don't go plow the fields, you don't go harvest the field. You don't work in a blacksmith shop. You don't you don't, you don't do the sales, you don't, you don't do all this up. You just hang it up one day a week."
" I love Sabbath, the older, I get the more I need it yesterday. You guys yesterday I took a Sabbath my family and I we took a Sabbath. It's been really tough. Now that Lee has working trying to find that Sabbath. It's almost like we have to plan at the week ahead to get it on the right day. Sometimes it's very difficult to do but yesterday we took a Sabbath and we told the kids Friday night we said hey tomorrow Saturday we're taking the Sabbath as a family in my kids started clapping and cheering that we love."
" Of Sabbath Sabbath is the best because we don't make them do any chores on Sabbath because we don't ride them very hard. I'm very disciplinary and I'm very authoritative with my kids they get their jobs done but on the Sabbath we rest, we watch movies. I put on pajamas. We eat popcorn. You know, we rest and it's this beautiful habit of delighting and everything. God has given us delighting in the work that's been done Friday. I needed to work on the sermons a little bit more. I need to prepare"
" Things for mobile church at your mother's house II was I was all I was thinking about. Was that event? I was thinking about a thousand other things I need to do with school work. I was thinking about other Church work phone calls, I need to make. And then Saturday morning I just said, you know what? I'm going to throw the chips up in the air and let them fall where they fall Sunday morning. I don't care if I feel underprepared, I'm not going to work through Sabbath. This is difficult."
" But it's good because it breaks down the idol of busyness breakdown, the idol of work and career."
 One habit.
 Sabbath forms me.
 I form the Sabbath habit and then the Sabbath habit forms me and see what's starting to happen in my life. It's foundational. I believe we're going to hear more about foundational living next week and I'm very excited about that.
 Next.
" God had commanded all of his people, the Israelites give 10% back to the Lord, when you harvest a field, take 10% of that Harvest, and give it to the Lord. When you make a sale, and you've got a great big commission, take 10% of that commission, give it to the Lord. When you bring in an income from your labor take, 10% of that income, give it to the Lord."
" You have 10 sheep, give one to the Lord, you see it's a pit temp is really easy number to manage 10% tithing."
 We've preached. This not because we as a church are like oh we need your money or we're not going to make it you know something I could find a job somewhere else.
" Modeling whatever, I could easily go work, right? It wouldn't be hard."
 The church.
 Is this sitting around going? I just want your money. I just want your money. I just want your money. We want your heart to be in the right place.
" The habit of tithing 10% of your income and giving generously the habit of a generous life, breaks the idolatry of money in your life. Jesus Christ said you cannot serve"
" Two masters. You cannot serve, God and money. You're either going to serve money or you're going to serve God. You can't serve them both. So when we tie then we give to the church. When we say I'm a late at God's feet and give this to him and trust trust him with it. I'm going to take that step of faith and tithe. That's that's like saying in the face of idolatry. You're not my God, my God is my God."
" That's an act of service to the Lord. And that's a habit, you've formed the habit of tithing and the Habit will start to form you. It'll create a generosity in a freedom of worry. You stop worrying about bills. Like you used to, you, stop worrying about debt like you. Stop worrying about. How am I going to survive and pay the bills and how am I going to hit the car payments? How am I going to? What if my tire goes when you start tithing, that habit creates this confidence that God takes care of all your finances. Anyways and the Habit forms."
 You.
" You can talk to anybody that consistently ties and they will tell you that this is true. Anybody will tell you when you're faithful to God, God is faithful to you. You form the Habit. The Habit forms you"
" It's great, foundational living choose today, whom you will serve next habit."
 Gathering for corporate worship.
 I've got like three or four scriptures for that. I can't keep turning around or I'm going to die.
" I lay down on the floor and a minute and just preach from the ground. If you're all okay with that, huh?"
" I'm fine with that gathering for corporate worship. Now, I'm kind of preaching to the choir here because you have all gathered for corporate worship. You've done exactly what I'm talking about, you're making this happen and some of you joining us online, we're not shaming you for not being able to come. We are super glad you're joining us online. But but, but making a time of the week once, maybe twice, maybe a small group that you belong to for Bible study, or for encouragement, that's important to Any Time. Christians intentionally come together to honor God. That's what I'm talking about, for gathering for corporate worship."
" Scripture after scripture, after scripture, after scripture in the New Testament, love one, another carry one another's. Burdens do not stop meeting with one. Another encourage one, another speak the word, to one, another sing songs with one another. Give praise with one, another lift one another up in prayer. One another one, another one, another one, another one another, there's over, seventy one, another verses in the New Testament and the Old Testament is filled with Psalms that say, come to his courts, singing joyously Gather in his temple, with praise gather, gather."
" Rather God actually created holidays, where they were commanded to come together and gather for Great Moments of worship and said me and places and sending dogs and places like that where you can hear the word and you can lift up God's name in the community of believers."
 What greater formation than corporate worship.
 You gather and you come together and you get to see friends.
" You get to see people, you care about people, you like, hopefully there's some people here, you like there's some very light, we have likable people in this trial. We have some great folks here."
" Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's easy to like people around here, make friends around here. This is a very family-oriented. Oh, it's a wonderful Church."
" You get encouraged, you get that community that friend that family. I'm in. I belong. I'm part of this church body. That's great. That's important. And then we come into this room and there's a wonderful little countdown. Letting you know, it's about to start that. Anticipation starts to build. Then we sing songs to God."
" And these songs, man. They remind us things about God."
" Yeah. First song, we saying, Come All You broken, any Sinners, anybody who's ever screwed up. There's room for you at the river. Come on down. Let the chains fall and then we what else did we saying? Build your kingdom here. Oh, by the way, we want to see God's kingdom, expand. Let the darkness fear. We want to make sure that God's kingdom is established firmly in Greensboro. Let it be in Greensboro as it is in heaven. Amen. And amen. And we want to reach people for Christ."
" Christ and that song encourages us to think man we got to we got to go Reach people. We sing, I'll fly away and I saw the light reminding us when we came to Christ at one point in our lives and it changed. Everything it changed everything when we came to Christ. And one day, we're going to go reconnect with him in heaven. Even the worship starts to form us and encourage our soul and teach us. Wow, there's more to it than just my regular day, there's more to it than the rigmarole of regular life corporate worship starts to just teach something to"
" Very soul. And then and then we take an offering and that's an opportunity to give to the Lord. Like we just talked about and that teaches us man, we got a breakdown the idolatry of money and then and then when you hear the word and I know, I'm just a human and I'm going to screw this up an awful lot but God's word is God's word and it shapes your life."
" It shapes your life, Thy word. I have hidden in my heart that I might not sin against thee. That's a pretty good promise, right? Like it purifies. You it cleanses you. It makes you hold me. Talk a little bit about that tonight. Jesus said I am the vine. You are the branches remain in me. I remain in you view, our main in my word, you will bear much fruit. That's what he's talking about. God's word is so powerful. Its shapes. You it changes you at convicts you? I hope there are sermons that make you downright miserable."
" I hope there are Sundays when you come here and you leave feeling awful, because, you know, the Holy Spirit was working on you and you need to, you need to repent, and you need to change something and you need to reorient your life to be in line with scripture. I hope I offend you sometimes because Lord knows Jesus offended. A lot of people a lot of times"
" And that's a good thing. I hope there are sermons that encourage you, I hope there are times when you hear God's word, and you're ready to charge the gates of hell, with a water pistol. Like, let's bring it on. I'm Goin In. I hope that happens some Sundays for you. I hope there's some days where your comforted where you're coming hurting, just going on hand. I just want to hear from guys. I hope you hear God's word and you hear something. Pulled out of the message where you're just, like, oh, I needed that today."
" And you just used to the Holy Spirit, I preach whatever preachers, whatever happens, it's the Holy Spirit speaking. I can't tell you how many Sundays I've preached a message and somebody's come up to me afterwards and said pastor. When you said that, that at the da man, I just needed to hear that. And I'm going I never said that."
 You're hearing things and hopefully you are because that's the Holy Spirit speaking into your life. People need that it's the word of God. You form the habit of corporate worship and the Habit starts to form you.
" This is how you serve the Lord choose today, whom you will serve, as, for me and my house, we will gather and worship and I will train my children in the patterns and rhythms of Sunday is worship day. And, and one day during the week, we do small group as a family. We are kids, don't quite participate in the Bible study. They run around like Hooligans making noise and distracting us from the Bible study, but we love them and that's part of it. And We Gather in our small group, I love my small group. I love my small group. I need my small guy."
" I didn't like it at first. No offense. For those of you who are in my small group, but I'm not like an extroverted person, an introverted person. So, a bunch of people in my home, that don't know. That's, that's like Terror number one, right? Like I who got over it, we gelled, I love my small group and I look forward to my small group every when I adore my smile and when I get a chance, I crash the Tuesday night, small group because I love that small group to that is an incredible group of folks."
" Everyone smile put my head on the Monday morning. Small grass, a great small group to prayer time. I love it."
" These habits form us, we form the Habit, The Habit forms eyes for, you know, what? You're serving the lord."
 Next prayer and meditation.
 Got five minutes. So I'm going to make this one short.
 Foundational. Christian Living Prayer and meditation.
 You go to the Lord in prayer.
 In Jesus's model prayer.
" Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name,"
 There are so much in that prayer to teach us about prayer.
 God is in heaven. My prayer life reminds me that he's not a throne and that I'm on the Earth.
" Give us this day, our daily bread, that prayer, trains me that I need to be praying every single day."
" So I set up times in my life since we moved here, one of the things that the Lord convicted me of and put on my heart. When we first got here. When we first landed, we're just learning what George is all about, what greensboro's all about, what Wesley Chapel is all about. We decided we were going to try to set up new habits. We're going to try to form new habits because my self-discipline was lacking and I wanted to become a man of self discipline. So started waking up at about 4:00 4:30 every morning."
" Consistent with that. I still do that. I got up this morning. My back hurt. I got up anyways. Right. I walked on the treadmill for a mile even though my back hurt like crazy probably that's why it hurts because I'm not smart enough to let it rest. But but it's during my morning routine, I spend 15 every 15 minutes. I have an alarm set every 15 minutes of my morning routine. Last about two hours every 15 minutes. I pray, I pray for you guys. I pray for the church and pray for the community. I pray for my own self. I pray for my family, pray for whatever else. God leads on my heart. Every 15 minutes, I pray."
" Because I need to do it daily and I need to force myself into that Rhythm. If I don't, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. And I spent about 45 minutes or so listening to the word of God. A meditating on what the word of God, says every single day no days off, no breaks, no no quitsies every single day because I need daily. Bread, daily bread, not stale old yesterday, bread, not doughy, uncooked, tomorrow bread. I need daily bread every single day."
 And so I spend time in the word and spend time in prayer.
" We're to do this. You form this Habit. In this habit, forms you. I feel my life Keeling out steadying out evening out and of closeness and a calmness and a general sense of Peace. When things that would normally have just kind of sent me spiraling, come up,"
" I laugh at it. Oh well, that's not a good thing, but, okay, we'll handle it. Why? Because I'm rooting my life into the Bedrock of scripture, in a new, kind of way, because I'm allowing a habit to, for me, I forced myself to form this habit and this habit forms, me. And this is what we are to do. If we want to serve the Lord, I gave you some foundational practices."
" Some foundational habits corporate worship. Come on, Sundays come to small group, make your life patterned in that rhythm of worship and and workplace worship and and Homeplace Worship in school. Make that your pattern"
" Giving saying I'm going to give to the Lord but he commanded me to give and I'm going to give even though it's scary. I'm going to give because it's right for my own heart, my own soul."
" Make that a pattern. Make that a habit prayer and meditation. I'm going to listen to God's words that God can speak to me. And I'm going to pray back to God, whatever I feel like he's leading me to pray. Make that habit, make that a practice. Make that a foundation."
 What was the other one? I think there was another one.
 Do you remember Sabbath who got it?
 I'm gonna rest. I'm gonna remember how amazing God is once a week. Maybe that's Sunday for you and this is part of your Sabbath day.
" We're living in a world that is anti Sabbath. How many of you remember a time on a Sunday afternoon, you couldn't find a restaurant open?"
" Our culture is pushing back against taking a Sabbath's rest. I can't do it on Sunday. I'm working right now, right? Like this is this is not my Sabbath. I try to take my Sabbath when my wife is 3. So now, it's now either going to be a Saturday or some Wednesdays and if we can't line it up where we get to take Sabbath together on a week. That's okay. I'll take a Sabbath on a Friday. Call me. Guess who's not answering his phone? This guy. It's an emergency call Julie."
 Call me and then I'll tell you it's probably not that much of an emergency Sabbath. Hang it up and we rest
 Because nothing depends on me. It all depends on God and he can take care of it and I can rest. That's a beautiful thing. So these habits
 are all designed to break down the strongholds of idolatry in your life.
" So when Joshua stands before, the people and says choose today, whom you will serve. He's saying, are you going to get into the habit of idol worship or you're going to get into the habit of Yahweh worship?"
" Are you going to build into your life, the patterns and The rhythms of obedience of prayer and meditation of giving and sacrificing and living generously? And and worshipping, are you going to build those habits in your life?"
" Or you're going to get into the habit of idol worship and I'm out of time and I have a lot of time to talk about what habits of idol worship. Look like there's another half to this. We might get to it someday. Who knows? Behold the habits, build the habits. Change your life. Pretty amazing."
" I'm going to pray and then I want to reiterate one of the announcements for today. So let's let's pray. Father, you are good."
" You Are Holy, you are worthy of my devotion. You're worthy of my praise. In my adoration, you are worthy of me. Patterning my life to fit The rhythms of your kingdom. May my life be foundational on you in my habits. Reflect a man after your own heart."
 May that be true of our congregation Jesus Christ. May we be a people who have shaped our lives to you rather than trying to fit you into a life. We've already shaped. We love you so much useless Christ. Did you form us? Help us to make habits that shape Us in Jesus name. We all pray.
 Amen.
" Next Sunday, we're doing a membership class after church, if you're interested in membership, we have a few people that have shown interest in that. So this Sunday after church youth, quick youth meeting informational meeting for teenagers that want to go on the mission trip this summer. We're just going to answer a few questions and give a little rundown and what it's going to look like tonight."
" At mr. Lindsay's mother's house Marie Marie Lindsay's. We're going to be doing mobile church. That's I think it's right across the street from you guys, right? So if you know where Tom and need a live, you know, where Marie Lindsay lives. So it's right in that neighborhood, you'll see the sign out front. So we're going to gather for worship at six o'clock and I got to say, I got to say something here. And I want to give kudos to a few people. When we do these kind of events, for example, the"
 And Wesley Chapel Band. We go on play. Sometimes Friday night. I saw two of our people doing something. So incredible. I just want to brag about it.
" You guys invited friends that you hadn't seen for like 30 or 40 years to come out and you shared about our church and you had great conversations about Christ. I'm sure that was read it into their somehow or made its way in. And and I saw a Rosa at the bar that was awesome. I look up and Roses just chatting it up with this couple that I assumed she's known for about 50 years. And I wanted to go over and meet her friends, and she had just met them that night."
" And she was telling him all about our church and how great it is. And that's why we're doing this. We're trying to put our church into the community. So any time we're doing this kind of community events like mobile church, tonight, we don't want to just go and make a lot of noise and preach a message at at some people that have gathered. We want to make sure that we show up as a church and we engage with people and we shake some hands and we say hi, I'm from Wesley Chapel, you want to know more about Christ, you want to know more about our church, want to know more about how you could be disciple because we want to see the real transformation."
" Open and real relationships and real connections happen. And I saw that happening Friday night and I was so delighted with what I saw. When we got to keep that kind of thing going, which is what I'm hoping to see tonight. So, come on out, come on out. I'm going to preach a whole new message. You're gonna be great. You're gonna love it. And, and, and, and talked to some neighbors that might show up. Hopefully, show up. It's your job to make sure they show up. So if they don't show up that's on you, but but connect with our community, that's what we're trying to do, but the church in the community. So,"
 I love you. You are dismissed.
You can page. So you're listening to you want to watch the broadcast over the radio or on Facebook? It's probably broadcast through which one which one you get. This is mine. That's the church. That's youth. Yes.
"this one here is for you, and this one would be you P, you"
" Okay, so now we got that going on. Now, we'll go through a few announcements this morning as you know, most of you know. Well, pretty much everybody knows. This is what"
" Correct. So, with that, in mind, they also cover campus called for your day of prayer tomorrow. April 27th from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. please join him in prayer for him the Stables."
" Leaders and the ones on the front line fighting medical disaster and the pastor. So I checked into your local high schools as well. I encourage you to do this, even if you're at work, when you stop and say a prayer during the one-hour time with 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. tomorrow morning. Also, there are victims of our church members and visitors."
" Turkey's simply could open for radio service at 11 a.m. for worship on story and possibly May 17 based on what the numbers are doing and how our state is progressing towards snapping. This curve going back. The other direction, there would be no Sunday school. Let me reiterate, that will be no son."
" The closeness of sitting at a table especially with my time is up in the Youth Department, that would be probably climbing on each other."
 This.
" Messy announcements at any point in time during the services. Like to do a high, they're offering right shit into our church. If the address is 2006, Orton, Street being Point, Georgia, 300 3066, 9 hours for that but you can give even though you are at home,"
 Appreciate it.
 They can also make a deposit at Bank South straight to First Baptist Church.
" Robert is a, we need to keep him in prayer. Also"
" also PC with she Brown and Hazel and Henry Phillips also keep the family, go steal your hearts and prayers as they lost Joe couple days ago and"
 Anything else?
 All right.
 In this church and the words of mark question mark getting to propane towards all of us will take you to the community. We think of the people that are on the front line
" And I'm president and all all military guys and women that are out there. Cleaning, nursing homes, for those that are sick with the covid-19, we think you do the front line, people, the nurses and the doctors, we actually get to look them up in prayer and that you protect them from from this disease. That is overtaking this world and the numbers are coming down with that as well."
" But we actually get to the ones that I've mentioned in the prayer of the ones that are sick, in the ones that aren't here, that we call them, and the Last Supper."
" Checking in on connect their Spirits, high. And we thank you that their families are calling on regular basis and showing them love and absolutely"
 Why don't we are going through medical disaster?
 Yesterday.
 We movie.
" now, or later on this week or later on,"
 Grab one of these.
 trying to make sure everything gets right on the
" From all over from, from Pennsylvania, from Utah, from Oklahoma, and from Guyana. So we're glad that you're, if you're tuning in and are pretty good. Gospel is reaching back to the 60s. There was a, there was a guy named Jack Kerouac, who wrote a book called on the road and"
" he wrote this and his whole premise was to tune in, turn on and drop out and put, this is going to be a different story. You turned it to Luke chapter 24, Luke chapter 24 of the significant road. Now, I'm talking about the times with the resurrected Jesus, for all of this. So, I'm talking about times of people, saw the Risen Christ. There's a lot here to things and I'll talk about"
" But Jesus, if he is not risen that I love all people should be very busy because I've given my entire life for him, keep it up a whole lot of things. But and I've got some friends that for a little while, we're saying, you know, the important thing is to be good. The important thing is to be a good person to be, you know just follow what God. Why is follow the rules are? And that's the thing that's important in life."
" My religion is worthless, the entire Bible from Genesis onto the book of the Revelation is all focus on the centrally on, on the cross of Christ him, be crucified died, and then resurrected, because to me, there's nothing without them. So I'm going to call this one the road with Jesus or I'll say do tell. So you sometimes when you want to know something from somebody. You know somebody will mention something."
" so,"
" Discussing together as you walk along, they should still the reason L cash. One of them. Are you the only one busy?"
 Who is not know the things that have happened.
" What things do tell he asks about Jesus of Nazareth, are applying, he was dropping powerful and working people for God. And all the people, the chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death and they crucified. But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel and what is more, is the third days is all this took place. In addition, some of our women amazes, they went to the tomb early this morning, but"
 Find five.
" They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said he was alive. There's some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but they not see Jesus. He said, is that how cool is you are and how slowly all of the promises? So he's not the Messiah had to suffer these things and then enter his glory and beginning with Moses in the promise, he explains them all in the same scriptures concerning himself as they approached the village."
" They were going Jesus continued along as if he were going farther, but they urged them strongly staying with us, where it is. Nearly keeping the day is almost over. So he went to stay with them while he was at the table with them. He took bread, gave thanks and the yang"
" Peace be with you. Now, get this. The funny story is very interesting story and it's only told in the Gospel of Luke. So this is what makes it so interesting is that Jesus comes up."
" And I've talked to many folks in sometimes, I have questions about the gospel. Do I ask questions about Jesus Christ? And I said to myself,"
" at which point I just turned everything off because I knew we were not on the same page, not because I was willing to engage, but I thought you've never even looked into Christ and enough to know whether or not he was actually real. So at this point and understand what is happening on the first day."
" People who were there you go to John chapter 19, you'll see that it talks about close pass. The rule was the husband of Mary, son of Mary, the wife of box and here, the talk about Polly Applause. So they were all there. It would make sense that they were all there. The women came the next day on Sunday on Easter morning. After the South and understand the way the Jewish culture goes during this hour on Saturday, they probably would have"
 all just stayed there with later the crucifixion on Saturday.
" This group to fill them. So, my guess is that on Sunday of Easter Sunday afternoon, they're walking back. Seven miles to where they live and now, as they walk back suddenly a person comes up and walks alongside of them and said, hey guys, what's going on there? Have you not heard what's going on? Are you the only person who doesn't know that Jesus was crucified?"
" Some point, when you come to know Christ, you've got to know him deeper more personal way. These folks were followers of him they were disciples. However, now Jesus has stepped his game up a notch."
" So the first thing is, if you seek Him person, is he walks with you? Look down at verse 15 and verse 15. It says, now on the same day, two of them were going to Village called Emmaus about seven miles from Jerusalem, they were talking with each other about everything that happened as they talk to each other. Jesus himself came up and walked along with, but they were painting."
" There's a lot of times, especially at this time, like this time in our, in our present circumstances, there covid-19 that we're not quite sure where Jesus is, and sometimes we're wondering, and like I said, over the past few weeks we've summoned, put God on trial and said, why isn't you are allowing some terrible things to happen. We pray to be delivered from God from our troubles and say, where are you going? We're not delivered from our truck. They were delivered from Rome. And they said, we bought this with the guy who's going to be"
" We thought he was the one balling for three years and we thought he was the one. And they said, are you the only one that was just in Jerusalem and he said,"
 But we go by here. We want to hear that. He's going to pay our utility that. We want to hear that. He's going to deliver us out of this pandemic. We want to hear that. He is going to bring us to Eternal happiness. Peace. We don't want to hear
 That he has killed our sin.
 But we had a debt to you.
" That there was nothing that could be done until he paid the price. We don't want to hear that. We don't want to hear that. He had to be beaten. He had to be last. You have a dry of cruel and horrible painful, gruesome death. Some people really want to see The Passion of the Christ because they don't want to see it and then I want to hear it. That was necessary for us but we want to hear that."
" This magic Genie, who is going to deliver us from everything because he wants us to be happy. There's a lot of people preaching that and you'll see them on actually right after we turn on the television and they'll have the Visa MasterCard logo on the corner that you can donate to them. They're saying, God wants to deliver you and please send some money my way. While you not saying if you want to send something that you should send something, the first type of shirt, please, please do, but we don't want to see that guy."
" We don't want to see ugliness of agape love agape. Love the reason I say it's ugly, you're still able love is in trouble. I got love for Chris, Chris is my buddy. He's over here."
" She loves you have for somebody that I have for my wife over here. And that's, that's a pretty love, you know?"
 In the desert.
" When Jesus was having fasted for 40 days and Satan came to tempt him, did he use some magic Jesus powers to, you know, Satan tempted and he said turning stones to bread. You can do it, but instead use the word of God. And now Jesus is on the road with them and takes over the conversation. He said, what was going on and they see said, do tell and they said,"
 He was the deliverer and now Jesus teaches the word of God Open the Eyes of those who he is with. So he opens the scripture of now it says down here that opens things for us
" Some of you like the teaching of of your pastor, or peer-to-peer chaplain or whoever you're watching. Some people are enjoying during this. This pandemic. Natives watched several different church services on Facebook throughout the week you know, and different things going on because they listen to this one now. And this one later, this one Tuesday, and there's one on Wednesday. Sometimes you like seven. Imagine"
 A personal teaching from Jesus.
" All the scriptures about where he 50mm do all the scriptures. I can't imagine how this was. I can't imagine how he probably would have been, you know, and then verse 28. This was how incredible it was verse. 28 says, they approached the village where they were doing Jesus continued on as if he was going farther. He was like, well, I gotta go, we'll see him. And he had just caught it and then we're so involved by his teaching. They wanted to say that."
" Jewish culture was to keep people because at night was going to be dangerous, it was going to be dangerous, to go out a dangerous to travel, so they would say come say, save yourself. Save the kitty. So, open City. Open first. Open the description. Now, it was so good. They urge to the say other words, there is that they almost visit Lee, kept him for to stay there."
" Stay with us for, it's nearly even. The day is almost over. So he went in the same way. Now, this situation, just whole picture is very interesting. They just had a set of Jesus himself. They didn't want him to go when, you know, when, you know Jesus things organization. My commander curled. Up, Ashley, when I was overseas, he said at work, do you sit here proxy? Do you enjoy Catholic mass? I had to think about"
" There's a tree. This mystery, This Love This murder. It's all in the Bible. Everything that you want to watch on Netflix is all in the Bible is Well written, it's a well-written book, I have read scripture because of my degree and because of my curiosity, I've read from different other texts, other religious texts, and a lot of them are written terribly. The, the Bible is a very well-written was hard literature, those as well."
" A great piece of literature. It's a great piece of history and it's just got a great story to it but Jesus didn't stop there after the open the scripture, then he opened something else. So this is now following members so follow. If I came in and sat down again"
" Also, people will say, we're going to assume I'm going to pray. Listen. All of you pray, really?"
" Legionella, you pray to Mary prayer time. Michael raised very, very, very few career. So there's a lot of people who do, but we can just kind of assume I will. Well, this is kind of different Jesus. They don't know who he is. He's just a person who has been teaching. He just grabs you and says, it's just kind of odd because it was"
 And then their eyes were opened.
 Their eyes were opened and they recognized him.
" Now, so he doesn't just open the scripture to us and opens our eyes, he opens our eyes to see how things are over there."
" He was when you recognize Jesus there will be a change. There will be a life change, something will be different in your life. We're not all here this morning with the, you know, live that the power off just because we like hanging out, we're here to fulfill what he desires and to bring worship to you. The worship that we are already feeling, we're trying to bring that you so that you can understand how we"
" Feel about it because Jesus makes a change in your life and now here's the thing. So they knew who he was, they knew that he has risen as we say on Easter morning, he is risen. He is risen, indeed. He is the scientist. I had to put sin to death. I remember Travis accepted Christ."
" Accident and he has six figures worth of hospital bills that were just eating him obvious family. $300 a month, you know, and that he figured you should be paying for the rest of his life. And he was just down and Founders relationship. He's down and everything else, being my friend David. We pray with them steps to Christ and it's like immediately. In fact, it was immediately as soon as I walked out the door because it's a blank and really this was long past or cooking time."
" Everything is the same, it's all going to be okay."
 Jesus is God.
" And I was like, wow, that's my girlfriend."
 Church will not be boring. They said there's a reason that the people of this church are ready to get back together. The community and fellowship.
" Disappeared. They said where our hearts burning within us. While he talked with us on the road and open the scriptures to us, they got other ones, they returned to Jerusalem and they found the eleven and those with them assemble together and said is true. The Lord is risen"
 About the pillar of cloud gives shade by day and it gives us people Fire by night and light By Night dwarfed by. I do wrong.
 The tongues of fire from heaven.
 I wish I could tell you but he needs to open your eyes.
 He needs to open the surgery. He needs to give you understanding do that. You need to be walking. You need to be seated.
" so, I prayed"
 In your life that you let us know. And then she would just just send us a word of encouragement and let us know what's going on. Please listen to the lyrics of this song as we close out this morning.
"Good morning, everyone. Welcome First. Baptist Church. We've got a little technical difficulties today because we are out of power and everybody's got fans. Thank you. Keep cool. We've got a few views showed up this morning, let's hear plays up early."
 Nice. I'll get a chance to talk to you afterwards. It's nice to meet you and let's see if we do happen to go back to Power will start kissing everything back there.
" Okay, so I can't come and get you."
 And we'll get started.
" We are coming up with a game plan for Wednesday, night for week in a row, kind of a BBS type thing, with some crabs and stuff as as are fake charged open up. What, right? We're going to open up, totally better."
 What call the backyard Bible Club?
" pray for the ones that are on the list and we're getting on the list and the people that I don't know,"
" Louisville is pray for them. Please get the names to us. That way we can ask. I'll have them on Sunday morning also heat the heat, the families of the crew, it family and LaMont family in your prayers. They're the ones that was flying from Florida to a funeral Indiana and the plane crashed in Putnam County. Please keep those families to declare with that. Let's"
 Even though we don't have air conditioning that we are here to represent and collect together and worshipping together in the past. So we thank you for the ones that have come here today and the ones that believe that are here
 Some of the worst.
" This court described times right now and we're doing all weekend as humans to look forward to you for guys looking towards you to collect and become one as a nation towards you. And Lord, I hope that presenting tray that you touch those that are"
 Not looking forward to you coming together as a nation with love peace or one that I mentioned on the prayers. I asked if you cover them as plank love and so the ones that have lost loved ones. Shown beloved.
 Give me a favor.
" This morning, we were expecting the power to go out. So they're playing a best Dove on Doc, 103.9 on the radio. So we're doing what we can, but we've got several people."
" Que le and Michael Huff, I know that Miss Sherry Dinars going to be happy to know that you brought your entire family and good to see all of the balcony to. So let's go to the Lord in prayer before we engage in more worship. Heavenly father, I thank you so much for allowing us to be gathered here together today. Lord, I Thank you for modern technology Lord. We get spoiled though. With all of this, we get spoiled with the fact that we can broadcast on 30 to everyone, you know?"
" All of the same time but also Lord. I Thank you for the ability to do that and and Lord. I apologize for myself includes everywhere that we haven't been using that to the best of our ability up until now. I think of, you know, air conditioning, the electric light bulb, all the things that we've gotten came. Usually first to our churches and yet we've been the last ones to broadcast, you know, all over the world. So thank you, Lord, for the ability to do that. I thank you for these who are behind me who have been willing to"
" go unplugged this morning and Lord. I pray that you would just love and inhabit our worship this morning. I pray that it would be special and meaningful that you would hear our praises to you. And that that we would continue to, we would go out and heal people in your name. We love you. We thank you. And praise when we pray for our nation at this time. Everything that's gone on. We've had covid-19. And now we've got riots and protests over over an unlawful."
" So God, I pray that you would heal our land heal our nation hear our prayers here, our worship this morning, as it's all still about a relationship with you. Thank you Jesus, for everything that you've given us. Thank you for the life that you have. Breathed into us and your name. I pray these things. Amen and amen."
 There we go.
" and now because of all that my Bible,"
" About the things that have happened in our world. All the things that have gone on this week, there's been a lot of Injustice."
" It's been a lot of things that have happened this week, and there are the various folks. I truly believe. Thank you. Yes, that will that have been forces that were at work and what I try to do messages, week is her"
 I know we've heard that a lot but generally people who are hurtful or ugly are people who've been hurt themselves. And there's a there's a whole lot that is going on over the past little bit. I think they haven't stopped to realize that they cooked us up in our homes for two months. And then all of a sudden there is no Injustice that we've seen. We don't feel confident in our government because they don't seem to know what to do in this situation.
 Not happy.
" Then all the sudden you add in, you know, something that fuels the fire and how now we have, you know, riots that have happened. So I've seen a whole lot of things this week. Listen to What a lot of people have had to say, and I want to know where what direction, God led me to, and the direction is hope so. I just pray that we can have hope that our nation. Once again, I pray that we can come together as Chris said, we seem to be divided right now and I pray that we can come together. So I wanted to talk about that and so terrific."
" This week from a chaplain friend of mine Joplin, not pastor."
" Who sent me a meme and said, praying for you? Because and I will say last week in this week, I did messages. Do I have to worry about? Am I going to lose my job for me? But I'm going to preach, what? The Lord lays on my heart. There's somebody needs to say something to me about it. Please feel free to, I am open to dialogue which is something that's not done often in our country anymore. We've gone to social media country and were used to making comments and likes and"
" Engage with each other face-to-face, much anymore. And that's part of the reason that this inflammatory situation has exploded the way it did that along with so many other package, but I want to talk about hope. Now, this is the real home. I preach this message, not the exact message fact, nowhere, close to the exact message, but for the same scripture, several years back and I called it, The Walking Dead or the living dead. I can't remember which one but if he jumps chapter 2"
" Timothy, most hopeful scripture that we have in our Bibles Ephesians chapter 2 says, as for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins in which you used to live. When you follow the ways of this world and the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit, who is now at work? In those who are disobedient? Also, all of us live among them at one time, gratifying the Cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and"
" We were by nature objects of rent but because of his great love for us. God, who is rich in Mercy made us alive with Christ. Even when we were dead in transgressions and it is by Grace you have been saved and God raised us up from Christ and seated us with him in the Heavenly Realms in Christ Jesus. In order that in the coming ages, he might show the incomparable Riches of his grace."
" Expressed his kindness to us in Christ Jesus for it, is by Grace, you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves. It is the gift of God not by works so that no one can boast for we are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus."
 This good work which God prepared in advance for us to do with great one more time. Heavenly father I thank
" For the word of God that. Thank you so much. Did you tell us? You have control over everything. Father Lord you have moved, Heaven and Earth. You gave your only begotten son so that we might have eternal life or maybe realize this may, we turn toward you at this time and lorda, it doesn't matter if it's a power outage or if it's a broken building, or it's a fire,"
 You are in control and you want us to turn toward you.
" At these times we thank you Lord that you are with us at all times, the good and the bad that we turn to you in the back times."
" And to make our good times that much sweeter. I pray these things in the name of your beloved Son. Jesus, and whose name I pray. Amen. Amen and amen."
" I'm tempted to not talk about this but I'm going to talk about it. You know, Injustice happens."
" And we have to be honest. About the one thing I've talked to, a lot of my African-American friends and other creatures and whatnot, this week is what I think what they said, what needs to be done is needs to be talked about. We often don't talk about and I myself as a preacher. I generally try to stay out of political discussion. I try to stay out of all this kind of stuff. So let me tell you something that happened."
 Not too long ago. And I really
" this is painful for me to share, but I'm going to"
 Injustice happens. Always raised my kids to follow the law to respect Leo's law enforcement officers and to appreciate that.
" There was a young lady who left for school early in the morning, 7:00 in the morning. Forgot her wallet. And she's going to run out of gas on the way home, but she went ahead and went on to school and then try to come home."
 And it was not too far from here.
" Well, then she saw a policeman roll up behind her. And she thought, oh great. Good, she went off the road thought. She ran out of gas. You came back on, she rolled off the road again because her car ran out of gas."
" Policeman and she saw a policeman, a rearview mirror. She thought, great fantastic. I've got a cop behind me because there's no. So,"
" So cough came in started, smelling her car. So what's that? Baggage she said I have a one-year-old. It's a Cheerios bag. God search your car. She said, yeah."
" He searched your car, then he gave her a field sobriety test outside of his car."
 Then they said she was on multiple narcotics and arrested her for DUI.
" Call her parents, who are keeping her one-year-old."
 Her parents came.
" And he started fussing at them and said, there's nothing you can do. I am taking her to jail, we said that, sorry. So let me just say this is, this was Jensen low. My daughter is sitting four rows back. If you see my hand, shake it because I've never wanted to hit a law enforcement officer in my life. Before that day. I'd do it right, man. I know his name. I know what county he works in. I've talked to his supervisor and I'll tell you what. Now, the way I feel not just"
 But in the past years I've been taking a look at cops overstepping their boundaries. I would absolutely hire a lawyer in a heartbeat. Am I share this with anybody? No. Do you know why? Because it's embarrassing and it hurts our social status and I'm worried that my job and I like it the people may not like it and this is why we're in the situation we're in.
" That guy didn't have a profile, my daughter's not black but apparently he likes to arrest young women different colors but about the same age. Not sure why I'll probably address this with this officer did with his Superior officer again, because I am so upset by it. I'm still shaking right now. I'm so angry about it and let me tell you what happened. So they searched the car found nothing, they gave her a field sobriety test and he said, nope."
" I should we have on our phone, we have a thing that shows where she's been she left, athletes check. And this person said, you don't know where your kids been, you don't know where your child's been over. He did"
" He said she's going to jail. We followed to the police station to the fire station. I should have called in the police station range came there but I know that I felt helpless. I don't know what to do. I've never been in that situation before, I don't have lawyers on retainer. I don't know what to do and he and then he said you know what, all you gotta do is put up property and you can get around on bail. No problem. I said I don't have property there. I'm a pastor a small town nearby. What in the world?"
" There's no big deal that she was being separated from her child for one year, for Susie for eight hours, and that she was going to jail, not to mention that quarters. You supposed to do? Her internship for teaching that they had won a background check. It would have come up but she had an arrest record. He could have destroyed her life permanently"
 and what if she didn't have to marry parents who cared about her? What a baby she'd only have a single parent who's watching her child. They couldn't even come out. What if she have have been lower-income? What if she had been kicked out of the house at 18 or 19 and she was on her own and nobody went together?
 Of one police officer.
" She could have no hope for the future if she has been lower income. If she had been maybe if she'd been black, if she had had only one pair for no parents to watch out for her, we fought for her. When I went to court, I've brought all the information to the district attorney and I said there were no drugs in her system. There was no alcohol in her system. We have record of where she was 15 minutes before the arrest which was 15 minutes across town. So what happens now? You said, excuse me. He went got paper."
" And I said, are we going to get to face the officer or we come back to court? He said, oh this isn't going before he said I don't have a case. Why would I try this?"
" Sort of doing a lot of research that point and that was why I said, you know what, there are bad eggs in the world, you need to watch yourself. There are bad things that happen in the world and we need to watch yourself. Now, this is one Injustice for me a middle class white man and this happened several years ago and I said nothing about because I was worried about my status and my social status, what people would think of me and all that stuff, she has no record because there wasn't a case against you"
 How often does this happen and African-American neighborhoods in low-income neighborhoods in Hispanic neighborhoods? How often does this happen?
 But we say nothing because it doesn't affect us.
" Injustice happens in this world. It happens every day and we close our eyes to. If we don't look at it, we try to pretend that it doesn't affect us at all, but there's a reason that we need to share price constantly and consistently because we have a lost and dying world out there. Now, how does that tie in with Ephesians? Paul is talking about the world and about us."
" And the way we used to be, as if we were dead people, here's the thing, I can go over here to the cemetery and I can't reach as hard as I want on how they need to stop sinning. And they're not going to hear me because they're dead. And what Paul is saying, in Ephesians chapter two, is you word that dead before Christ raised you"
 that's poem.
 That's a hope of a God that can change things.
" The first one we were dead. We were like zombies. Like I said, I go to the grave in the tree."
" Some follows that he said, we followed the course of this world. Listen dead, man. You take a dead man. You know, with no hope. Imagine for a minute, take dead people, or people who are spiritually Dead, who have no hope in Christ Jesus. You put them in a quarantine for two months, they lose their jobs."
" They don't have enough money. They're not sure if everything is going to be shut off like the powers off today, then the government lets them down because they feel like the government doesn't have a clue as to what's going on in there. Not helping them anything. And then you see death or Injustice by a government official."
 That's what we call a Flashpoint. How you think. People weren't mad.
" I am not giving you an excuse to riding protesting is something we should be able to do in this country by our constitution. I'm not giving you two used to riding breaking things and hurting people, but you think they want trigger. You think I'm not triggered. I'll tell you what. I would go toe-to-toe with that Leo right now, it doesn't make a difference if you want to see what a daddy would do for his kids. Yeah, watch that. I would go to the gym right now, and this is almost two years later. I'm so curious. It makes me angry."
 Injustice before.
" Protests. Now, you have after two months of quarantine feel like the government, let you down government official murder. Somebody by Disney on somebody's neck because of camera phones. We've got video of all of it everywhere. Boom, Flashpoint. You think they weren't mad? Of course. Now, you put the various people in there. Who, when you're that mad, they say here's a brick. Why don't you do something with it?"
" And I'm not getting sick. I do not like the group, but we're not talking about black lives matter, we're not talking about other quotes again, the various people who are trying to incite violence and divide us that much more, that's why we need home. We need hope that Jesus Christ can raise deaf people because the people are going out there saying, I'm doing something now. I've been cooped up in my house. Now I can go do something."
 And then you have that person to Brick while they're angry.
 I actually saw somebody taking a break back to some of these cards and why would you have angry people to bring?
" So it's happening. It actually is happening. So I'll just you conspiracy. It's happening out there. See, here's the thing that people are going to act. Dead, spiritually, dead. People are going to act dead. They're going to act simple because they are dead. And it says in there that the spirit is at work in the sons of Disobedience, this evil spirit is at work in the sons of Disobedience, that angry wrong spirit with a brick in his hand is going to break something."
" We all live in the flesh. We all once lived in the flesh. We satisfied, our desires, our thoughts, that's what the scripture says. That's what he says right here in Ephesians hurt people. Hurt people."
 People who are hurt are going to hurt other people.
" hurt, people hurt people, dead people act dead, but"
 Second point.
" Godfrey first four,"
" Birth for says, but because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in Mercy? There are two words that changed everything in a person's life. They change it in scripture, but they changed it in people's life is two words that are uncannily. Just I can't tell you how much how much grace they can make you feel in your life and that is but God but God two most powerful words in Scripture."
" Being rich in Mercy, made us alive. What does that look like me? Show you what that looks like. If you want to turn in your Bibles or you got your Bibles or your phones or whatever to Ezekiel 37, I'm going to go over, what? That looks."
" It's because thousands of almost a thousand years before about 700 years before, God says to Ezekiel, son of man can these bones live now, these were Dry Bones dry. What does Dry Bones mean? That means inside when they're broken, the marrow has dried up. That means there's no light in them at all. They're all bone. This kind of bones are dog. Would come up to sniff and walk away from because there's not anything for him to chew on their old bones. And God said, Can these dry bones?"
" I said o Sovereign Lord, you alone and then he said he prophesied of these bones Dry, Bones. Hear the word of the Lord, I will make breath enter you and you will come to life. I will attach tendons and make flesh. Come upon you and cover you with skin. Then I'll put breath in you and you will know I have come to life, then you will know that I am alone."
" so as he'll did that, now here's the thing is God didn't just say, I'm"
" He starts talking about tendons, and ligaments, and sinews. And I mean, imagine the cartilage, the vein, the muscle tissue, all the things that would have to happen for dry bones, to be brought to life. Imagine"
" that's what that looks like. But then he prophesied and got put skin on them, and put the bones together and the tendons of Flesh appeared on them in the skin cover them, but there was no breath than that."
" Now I've said it before, Peter says, the word of God is inspired that word inspired, is the word Numa Numa, and the power of the word, the word of God, this is inspired by God and it's that work. New my means wind or breath. So instead, God breathed into man, and he became a living soul,"
" It's God's breath that has the power of the power is God's is God's breath inside of the word of God. The power. It us is the breath inside of us. And he had put ligaments and tendons, tendons, and sinews, and the Flesh on those bones, but there was no life in him."
" God is saying through Paul in Ephesians, that's what we were. We were dead and would and then he breathe breath in those bones. He said prophesy to the breath prophesy, son of man and say to him. This is what the Sovereign lord said, come from the Four Winds o breath and breathing to these flame that they may live. God said, our bones are dried up and our hope is gone. We are cut off."
 Have you ever felt?
" Have you ever been at a bad situation where you wonder if God's even listening to anything? You said, I don't think there's anyone within earshot of my voice was not felt like that. I have, I have a personal time and I have had that feeling at times in the church in every church I've ever been in. Before you say, it's just me, Mark, maybe the problems with you, that's it."
 Every pastor.
" I will say that they have had time when they were crying out to God. I have received so many sucker punches I can't even count them, but God."
" we were dead, but God and"
" I've also watched,"
" Relationships be prepared in my life. I've watched myself help other people repair relationships, brothers and sisters, Fathers and Sons children and parents."
" But learn to forgive and learn to love and learn to have life in their relationship. Again, some of them just before their, their, their loved one passed and it's so beautiful that I have any part of that from God."
" God can heal. We were dead, but God can heal. God can raise us up. And he says, by Grace, you have been saved. See, it's all about the grace of God. It is by Grace, you have been saved and raised us up. We have. Oh, so in the coming days, he may show us that says, his immeasurable Riches of Grace in Ephesians, immeasurable riches, a great. So,"
" Not just a little bit of Grace is, immeasurable Riches of Grace and kindness toward us. Understand something you've got to get this before I get to my next point and that is that God doesn't owe us anything he doesn't know us."
" I keep y or healing or salvation or hope he doesn't owe. Anyone of us, we were dead but we have hope."
 And we need healing.
 Let me tell you another story.
" I took a little bit of trouble, I was that person has almost become a regular part of our lives, but that person has gotten in trouble with the police. Not the choose great thing you got in trouble. So I took him home. Then I noticed on my way home, I was being followed by the police department."
" Now, I got pulled over."
" And then the person talk to me and then they pulled me over for a for a tagline. That was out. But then they said, oh, it's the preacher. Hey, it's the preacher of the Town preacher saw you taking that young gentleman home, what you doing? It's like I'm working with spends time you work with it or trying to get it, but you might want to watch yourself. I said,"
" I realized, you know what? I was just charging, but I'm the town preacher so they let that go."
" Now I felt kind of dirty because now the Good Ol Boy system worked out well for me, but in time it might not have been so good and I'm not been who I was and was town."
" And I understand, I love Leo's. I want to be won all of my life."
 Enforcement agencies that are here. I know the chief and I know the leaders of both of them very well. I call them friend. They're actually on speed dial on my phone. I've talked to them both this week.
" And so this is not something to say about police, but all the sudden, I felt kind of dirty because it worked out for me. Did I say anything? Nope. Did I go talk to their supervisor? No."
 I'm the problem.
 I've had a hundred stories from black Brands like preachers who have the same thing happening to do to lower it.
"Dear heavenly, father, we thank you for this day. We thank you for the opportunity that you've given us this morning to be able to wake up. Come to church and worship you together as a church, family Body of Christ. We thank you for this or we thank you for the beautiful weather that we have a hot Summer's days and the idea that possibly will help get rid of the covid-19 that we're all dealing with across the world as United States has opened up all these states and and the numbers seem to jump back up."
" The death rating. Thank you for. That is, is a lot lower than what it was before we thank you for this.

 Who's going to be a part of the family of God?
 I was kind of deciding what I was going to play.
" Determining that way things are going in our country right now. I say this time and time again, it seems like people are turning our eyes and we as Christians need to"
" Show our quality, the other people, as well, as make known that Jesus is our savior and getting control everything that happens in this country. But we've got to put him first. That way, you can covid-19 vide our country so"
" He's the one that gave us life and if he gives us why he is our father and our controller and we got to give him everything that we have back with us not doing. So, as far as a huge Nation goes in the numbers, we've got it's heartbreaking, sad, but I think this song because of that issue,"
" The others and it's probably some time, I'm not mentioning but I appreciate that. So much has been done. As you see stuff is change but we've had since we try to keep everything as long as we can for with covid-19 and to keep it as normal as possible and just to go on and and proclaim the word of God. So and not to mention, then there's also been the radio audience along with the Facebook poll audience."
" Which has grown, which is fifty or a hundred people a week with something. So and that was interesting trying to get the sound for that for both. So, so now we've got a hopefully we got everything about that to to sending normal and we'll see how that goes. But one thing I want to talk about this morning is is worried because I see a lot of that going on. A lot of worry about what's going on country was going on."
 Nation. A lot of worry about the covid-19 buyers a lot of worrying about racial tensions and Reconciliation and politics and that we have a vote coming up in November. There's a lot of worry to plenty for you to go around and do we wear masks and do not wear a mask and what the rules and are they going to turn to socialism to take all of our rights away? There's a lot of worrying going on in our nation.
" And the Bible speaks to worry. Matthew chapter 6 is where we'll be in verse 25 and 34, but I join the someone here is worried this morning about something that's going on that years ago. The Mayo Clinic says, they're told caseload in reality or artificially, do worry and anxiety. I've seen this myself that sometimes"
" And as they talk to me about the problems that they have going on at home suddenly they're probably pain, goes down and they're out of his path Arabic than a few weeks. I've seen it that's it's amazing I don't understand it but it's worry can kill us. One lead position say that his opinion 70% of all medical patients can cure themselves if they only got rid of their worries and their fears Medical Science has time or two hearts"
" To blood pressure to ulcers thyroid problems, migraine headaches to host a stomach disorder. America about 25 million Americans have high blood pressure due to stress and anxiety, eight million, people have stomach ulcers every week, a hundred twelve people unfamiliar people. Take medication for stress-related symptoms. Don't worry is a problem worries, an epidemic in our country, so what is Stanley Johnson? Worry is the interest. We pay"
 On tomorrow's Triumph. Let me say that again. Worry is the interest that we pay on tomorrow's jobs?
" He's going to become so preoccupied. With the Troubles of tomorrow that are present thoughts of trouble. No, man were saying that with the burden of the day. It is win. Tomorrow's burden is having to the burden today. With the weight. Is more than a man can bear George MacDonald's and that. So if you have your Bibles or your, or your iPad or"
" Jesus has to say about worry. Jesus said, therefore, I tell you do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink or about your body, what you will wear is not life, more important than food and the body more important than clothes. Look at the birds of the air. Do they not sow or reap or store away in Barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than who have you?"
" And why do you worry about clothes? See how lily they do? Not labor or spin yet? I tell you that not even Solomon. In all his Splendor was dressed like monkeys. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, oh, you of little faith? So do not worry saying what shall we?"
" We eat, what shall we drink? Or what shall we wear for the pagans run after these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them, but seek first, his kingdom and his righteousness. And all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow. For tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly father. Thank you so much for allowing us to have a lord for us being able to gather together in Florida."
" Courage for us to gather together in a house of worship. We need your spirits resting on this country. We just here to rest upon us. Lord, we need to cast our cares upon you because we know that you care for us and we need your peace. Jehovah Shalom. I pray that you will be with us throughout the service. You're out this week and with us as we speak about worry, anxiety and fear. Now they have no place"
 In your opinion.
 Or we thank you. That would be gathered together day and your name Jesus. I pray these things. Amen. And
" death was walking toward the city when the morning and there was a man dead and decent. That's what I do is my job, the man, her to warn everybody. Good about this plan and as he didn't fell."
" He said, you told me you were going to take a hundred people, he said 1,000. I said, I kept my word. I only took plenty worried took the rest,"
" The word great word for the word. Worry is Maryland. Which literally means to be drawn and different directions. When we worry, we're not seeing the line, we're not focused, we have things of the world that are pulling us in different directions. We allow that it pulls us apart and it's like trying to live a place where you're not. So so what is the cure to worry? Comes the moment when you realize a few things about worry and one of the worry is not healthy. It's not powerful and verse 27."
" It said, not an hour, can be added or a cupid to your statue. Is so, the way, the King James usury worry is needless because there's much more important issues that we so often become preoccupied with them. The issue becomes become preoccupied. With are usually not the things that we really need to worry about Soldier Under Fire, the Foxhole don't get upset. They're not, they're worried about living there."
" Before his 16th birthday, he was going to use Retreat. He wanted to use for treating win but he had quiz on Monday morning that he we should we study. So the whole weekend he was worried that he should have been studying for the quiz, whether whether or not he should have gone and he said all the way to one of the meetings. The"
" The van that he was in was hit by a truck. And so, he found himself in the hospital and his head was cut open. He was bleeding. He eventually had to operate on him and he was in the hospital."
 Does that have anything to do with your salvation?
" If we could see into the future and see into our problems in the True Light, just like that bomb and went blind us to the world to living itself. Instead, we could be relegated to their true size and their true Place have. All the things that most people worry about were reduced to their true size. You can probably stick them all on a water glass. To people worried today about a great many things people worried today about about people to work right now."
" They're worried about things that are going on. They're worried about racial reconciliation, they're worried about politics. They're worried about all the things in the world that are going on."
 And so the next day they got stood up and went to the door behind you.
" There's a picture of mental hospital to the law listening intent. And the attendant kept walking by smiling attendant comes by and and starts looking, which is"
 listen wall. And so the patient brings them over and they tend to press his ear to the wall for a while instead.
 I can't hear a thing.
" And the other person said, is the patient said. I know, it's not like that."
" That's a lot of times what our worry is, like, we're worrying waiting seeking trying to hear nothing."
" Isaiah 40 2931 talks about God, giving us strength said, he gives me speak of strength to the weary and increases power to the week even youths grow tired and weary and young men, stumble and fall. But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength, they will soar on wings wings, like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk, and not grow faint faint."
" Folks God wants to give us power over. He wants to give us power and me and our lives is wanted to take us over and take over everything that we do within the way we live. And we give us the problems that worry always gives us. He wants us to hand it over to him. That is why the second point I want to make? Is that it's not faithful to worry. It's Faith less to worry. Verse 30 says, oh, ye of little faith as"
" Talk about a little faith, the nature of God shows us, it's unnecessary to worry. Worry does empty tomorrow with sorrow it empties today of its strength."
" With Corrie Ten. Boom. But then in Auschwitz concentration camp and she said that, you said worry doesn't into tomorrow as it is, today of his strengths were, he's not too silly. It's also sinful. Worry shows you, you're not trusting God, as if you say that you trust someone but then your actions show that you're not trusting. It represents what unbelievers do and it shows that you don't trust God someone once said if"
" trust for his children, there's son of from a church but that said when your knees knocked together Neal,"
" When you start having what we start having anxiety, and worry. I'm not saying this will alleviate anything but we should pray with me. Pray like Jesus Commandments too."
" When Jesus first started the prayer with Jesus, start the The Lord's Prayer by saying, oh, Lord, help me with this problem."
" No, he should have fun with war in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Christian about any said my kingdom on Earth as it is in heaven."

Freedom is through Christ, my crew members and he said we can have true freedom is through"
" We have freedom in this country, freedom of speech, the freedom to say, what we want to go. One actually right now the rain is pandemic. Not as much as we have had in times past, but we have freedom in this country but true Freedom comes through Jesus Christ, that's know somebody like Corrie, Ten, Boom. Can worship God, even though she's in a concentration camp because of the freedom that Jesus Christ gives we need to believe our are, we need to disbelieve are simple."
" Has and learn to trust the unchanging nature of God. We need to not just pray for summarizing the season to come. We know, they'll come because God is faithful. We see God's provision all around us. We know that he is our father and fathers provide for their children. Our experience of him and his nature shows us that God can be trusted. So worried, his sentence room has a god tier Street. He's brought you through so many things."
" And I believe that he's going to continue to do so our heavenly father has never left us. He's promised us will never leave us and he'll never escape. This is why as we can memorize scripture and I pray stretcher back to God, I say God you know that the cattle the only cow"

" Worried about tomorrow and the things that are going to come. When Jesus said, do not be afraid of this name for the Lord, your God is with you."
" When you speak to us about worry. So, what is it that we can do about this? What is it that we can do with worry? Because everything works and I knew that as an excuse of them will ever know. Everybody worries. You can't help you. Just, you just have to some people. Worry a lot less than other people, though. So what do I do?"
