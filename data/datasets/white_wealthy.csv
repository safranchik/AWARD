" Dear friends. Let's love each other, because love is from God. And everyone knows who love is born from God and knows. God the person who doesn't love, does not know God because God is love. This is how the love of God is revealed to us. God has sent his only son into the world so that we can live through him. This is love. It is not that we have loved God but that he loved us. And sent his son as a sacrifice."
 It deals with our sins.
" Dear friends. If God loved us this way. We also ought to love each other. No one has ever seen God, if we love each other, God remains in us and his love is made. Perfect in us. This is how we know we remain in him and he remains in us because he has given us a measure of his Spirit. We have seen and testify that the father has sent the son to be the savior of the world if any of us confess."
" That Jesus is God's son, God remains in us and we remain in God, we have known and have believed that love that God has for us. God is love and those who remain in love, remaining God, and God remains in them. This is how love has been perfected in us so that we can have confidence on the Judgment Day because we are exactly the same as God is in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect. Love drives out fear."
" Because fuhrer expects punishment. The person who is afraid has not been made perfect in love, we love because God, first loved us. If anyone says I love God and hates a brother or sister. He is a liar because of the person doesn't love a brother or sister. Who can be, who can be seen? Cannot love God. Who can't be seen this commandment. We have"
" From him, those who claim to love. God, ought to love their brother and sister also,"
" So Friday, I attended the funeral of Clara, Helen Butler."
 Over in Cummings.
 She and her parents and grandparents and even great-grandparent are dear friends of ours like adopted family.
 I wanted to share with you this morning to begin our Sermon. Just the opening paragraph of her obituary that her family put together. It reads this
" Clara Helen, Butler 17."
 Of Lawrenceville Georgia passed away unexpectedly in her home on Wednesday. April 21 2021. Eight days after her 17th birthday. As a result of an accidental drug overdose.
 While her death was tragic.
 There is much more to her story.
 The service was a celebration of Claire Helens life.
 A celebration of her story.
" A celebration of how she loved all God's creatures, great and small. And how she would sneak rabbits and anything else she could find in the animal world and to her home,"
" Stories of how she loved others, like the homeless lady outside the store who On a Winter's day. Claire Helen could not just pass by"
 But she went back to her car. Got her coat and gave it to the lady.
 And then went into the store and bought her food and brought back to her.
 It was a story about how many people she had convinced through her lifetime of just 17 years.
 That God loves them.
" And how many of her peers, some friends and some strangers?"
" Were now Disciples of Jesus. The Christ, because of her Witness."
 There's always a lot more to one story than his obvious.
 There's more to your story.
 And there's more to my story.
" Then, others know."
 There's also more to the story of those who are very close to us whose story we think we know very well.
 There's also more to the story of strangers whose story. We assume that we know just because we had one interaction with them.
" In my closet at home, there is a dark navy suit."
 I wore it Friday to Claire Helens funeral.
" But somewhere over here on the sleeve of that suit, if you look really closely, there's a tiny little pinhole, a moth got hold of it."
" And as much as I like that suit that navy blue suit, I don't refer to it as the navy blue suit anymore."
 And I really don't like wearing it. I've almost discarded it a couple of times because the only thing I know about that navy blue suit is that it has this little pin hole over here in it. I probably wore it Friday and not one single person knew that pin hole was there but I knew it was there and the whole time I wore that suit I was thinking I hope nobody sees this little pin hole.
 It's not just the way we treat our clothes.
 It's the way that we treat ourselves.
 And it's the way that we sometimes treat others.
" no matter how beautiful the face, all we can see is that big zit"
 or that extra large nose.
 Or maybe that hair that just will not lay down.
" No matter how friendly, and loving and kind."
 All we can see is that one has more weight on them than they should.
" And no matter how gorgeous that shirt is that we're wearing, it's that one little stain right there that we focus on."
" It's kind of like somebody shared with me the other day if you hold up a whole sheet of paper, white paper and you ask, what is this? Everybody says this sheet of white paper. Put a little dot on the paper of ink and then ask what you see and everybody talks about that one little dot. Nobody talks about the white sheet of paper anymore. It's just the one little Dot."
 Is it that us?
" A perfect father, had two children."
" He provided everything, those two children could possibly need and and dwelt with them in Paradise."
 And surely nothing could go wrong with such a perfect set up. A perfect father who was always present Who provided for his children's every need and who lived with them in Paradise.
 But you know the story.
 Things did go wrong pretty quickly.
 And the father came walking along one day and his children ran and hid from him.
" And the father called out, where are you?"
" And one of his children answered, I heard you were in our midst."
 And I was afraid.
 Because I was naked.
" so, I hid"
" and the father asked his child, who told you that"
 Who told us that we should be afraid of God.
 Who told us that we should run and hide?
 Who told us that we should be ashamed and God's presence rather than being authentically just who we are.
 Blemishes and all.
 Who told us that we had to be perfect?
 To be loved.
 Who told us that God would focus only on the defects?
 And wouldn't know our entire story.
 Dear friends. God is always loving us.
" And when we like the prodigal son and Jesus parable, go running away. God is loving us while we run."
" And when we turn around and come back home, God is loving us."
" And even while we're staying close at home and never run away, God is loving us."
" but what matters is not, whether we stay or Ron, what really matters is"
 While we're living.
 Are we living in God's love? That is steadfast and eternal.
 Are we living in something else?
" Those who know, God know that God is always loving us."
 I agree with William Sloane coffin. When he said the opposite of love is not hate. The opposite of Love is fear.
" We no longer believe the lie that we need to be afraid and expect punishment from God. Instead, the writer of First, John tells us we have known and have believed the love that God has for us."
" We Trust in it. This is where we find our confidence. That even on the judgement day, we will not need to run and hide. Instead, we will stand confidently, and God's presence, not because we are there without any blemishes or any holes."
 Or because we are deserving to be there.
 But we will stand there confidently only because we believe God loves us.
 Loves us so much.
 That the father has sent the son to be the savior of the world.
 And we love.
 Because God first loved us.
" We love well, because we know that we are being well-loved."
 It's only the child who can give love is only the child who has received love.
" We forgive well, because we know that we've been forgiven. Well, we provide a safe and gracious, place for others to be themselves because we know God who has provided a gracious and safe place for us to be ourselves. We look beyond the defects and differences of others because we know a God who looks beyond our faults and sees only our needs and provides what we need in love."
" It is our relationship with God or more. The relationship God has with us, that calls us to have such relationships with each other."
 We only do.
" as we have known God to do to us,"
 My doctoral thesis was about how United methodists do funerals.
" and the need for us and time of funeral services to keep a balance between celebrating the life of the one who is deceased,"
 And proclaiming the gospel of Resurrection.
" And when I prepare a sermon for a funeral, I'm always looking for the places where the deceased person has exemplified Christ in their lives."
 Where they have made Christ tangible to us.
 And do you know that I have never failed to find something?
" Some place where that was true, even in the lives of people, who would never have thought they make rice tangible at all, even in the lives of people who said, I don't even believe in Christ."
 I've always been able to find someplace that they exemplify Christ to us.
" and I believe what happens is that, we find that for which we are looking for,"
 We find that for which we are looking for.
 Do you see the nice blue suit?
 Or are you looking for the pinhole?
 Do you see the tragedy?
 Or do you know there's more to the story?
 I always remember the joke.
 About the two guys in a small town who were brothers and both of them were meanest snakes.
 Just as mean as the day was long.
 And one day one of the brothers died.
 And the other brother came to the preacher and said to the preacher. There's a thousand dollars in this. You neural for you if you can say my brother was a good man.
" The preacher thought for a minute and he said, you got a deal."
" So, at the funeral service, the preacher got up and he just was honest. He told all the bad things, this man had done that, he was mean as a snake as mean, as the day was long."
" But he summed up the man's life saying. But in comparison to his brother, he was a good man."
" If we look hard enough,"
 we can see there's more to the story.
" if we truly get to know each other,"
 we know there's more to all life.
 But it's all about what we're looking for.
 And I often wonder why it is that we have to wait till somebody dies.
 Begin to see their true. Good attributes.
 Why is it till they die? We can only see the bad.
" And yet death, we become more compassionate."
 We become more loving.
 And we began to seek and to find who this person really was.
" Wouldn't it be great if we could just learn to live with such love and forgiveness, and mercy, and Grace, and generosity now."
 And not just reserved it for when each other are dead.
" In treating others in this light, it might just allow them to be open to God's transformation for them."
 It might just allow us to be open to God's transformation of us.
" This commandment we have from God, those who claim to love. God ought to love their brother and sister. Also, I mean, if you know, love your ought to be loved."
" So dear friends, let us love each other."
 Because love is from God.
 And everyone who loves is born from God and knows God.
" The Lord. Let it be for me, let it be for us, immerse us O, Lord in your love. So that there's no room left in us for fear only room for love along in the name of the God who is for us, who is with us and who is in US? Amen."
 Will you pray with me?
" God, who is always loving us?"
" Loving us when we love and return and loving us, even when we Rebel and run away from your love."
" loving us when we get it, all right, and loving us, when we get it all wrong,"
" loving us when we acknowledge that, we've gotten it all wrong and loving us when in our ignorance and arrogance"
 We have yet to see our faults and failures.
 Oh God. We pray this day that you're loved.
 Would help us to truly be a more forgiving people.
 That's you send us into a world not to see The Faults of everybody.
 But to see the good.
" Not to focus on Humanity's capacity for evil, but to focus on Humanity's capacity for good. Especially when we come to know you,"
" The God, Who is good and who is created us."
" Lord, we pray that you would send us Force into your world to be a more trusting people."
 To trust your love of us.
" And not to live our lives, in fear and hiding."
 But to know that we can fully be ourselves authentically and we can confess the truth.
" For you are a god who's not out to punish us, but out to love us and to change us."
 To make us new.
 And help us learn how to trust each other.
 Not to live in suspicions of our neighbors.
 And not to think that just because we walk by someone in a grocery store aisle that we know them.
 That we have some them up and can write their story. There's much more to their story than that.
 Teach us how to trust.
" And send us into your world Lord, to be more daring."
 To not be afraid.
 But to live our lives and to put them at risk to even lay them down for each other.
 Knowing that you are with us.
 That you will sustain us.
 That you will be with us every day of this life.
 You will be with us in our deaths.
 And you will be with us in the Life to Come.
" Help us to truly be a people of Faith. Have loved a people who are just like you in this world, loving caring, compassionate, kind gentle patient."
 Full of joy full of generosity faithful.
 And self-control.
" Allow your spirit to live in US produce much fruit through us for. This is our prayer that we pray in the Name of Christ Our Lord, amen."
" So Christ, Our Lord invites to his table, all who love him who earnestly repent of their sin and who seek to live and peace with one another. Therefore let us confess our sin before God. And before one another"
" Source of love and life. Your Glory knows, no bounds. We yearn to set aside our fears, but we are often afraid. We long to love our sisters and brothers, but we often feel alienated from them. We desire to abide in you as you abide in us, but we can't seem to figure out how"
" Show us once more how to love for Only Love Can cast out our fear, show us how to love one another well for only. Then can we truly know you show us how to abide in your Vine for only then can we bear the fruit that glorifies your name?"
" And all the people said, amen. When we abide in Christ, we abide in the vine of love and grace abide in the vine, and receive Mercy beyond measure and hear the good news of the Gospel, in the name of Jesus Christ, you are forgiven,"
" Glory to God and all men, the Peace of Christ be with you."
" Amen. Let Us offer ourselves as forgiving and reconcile people now to God, and as we bring our gifts forward, let us also hear the offering that the choir will make of music."
 Little drop of water.
" If you're able, please remain standing for the prayer of the great Thanksgiving."
 The Lord be with you.
 Lift up your hearts.
" Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God."
" It is right in a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give, thanks to you almighty. God, creator of Heaven and Earth you have made us through love. And through love, we have our being we can love because you first loved us. And so with your people on Earth and all the company of Heaven, We Praise Your Name and join their unending hymn, holy, holy, holy Lord, God, of power and might"
" Heaven and Earth are full of your glory hosanna in the highest blessed. Is he who comes in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest? Holy are you and blessed is your son, Jesus. Christ your spirit. Anointed him to preach. Good news to the poor to Proclaim release to the captives. And to set at Liberty, those who are oppressed. And to announce that the time had come, when you would save your people, he healed the sick,"
" Fed the hungry and ate with Sinners. And by the baptism of his suffering, death and Resurrection, you gave birth to your church, delivered Us From Slavery to sin and death and made with us. A new covenant by water and the spirit on the night in which Jesus gave himself up for us. He took bread. He gave thanks to you. He broke the bread, he gave it to his disciples and said, Take and Eat. This is my body which is given for you do this."
" This in remembrance of me and when the supper was over, he took the cup, he gave thanks to you. He gave it to his disciples and he said, drink from this. All of you. This is my blood of the New Covenant poured out for you, and for many, for the Forgiveness of sins do this, as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. And so in remembrance of these, your Mighty acts in Jesus Christ, we offer ourselves and praise and"
" Thanksgiving as a holy and Living Sacrifice in Union with Christ offering for us as we proclaim the mystery of Faith Christ has died. Christ is risen. Christ will come again. Pour out your Holy Spirit on us, gathered here. And on these gifts of bread and wine, make them be for us, the body and blood of Christ that we may be for the world. The body of Christ Redeemed by his blood"
" And by your spirit, make us one with Christ, one with each other and one in Ministry to all the world until Christ comes and final Victory. And we Feast at the heavenly banquet through your son, Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit in your holy church. All honor and glory is yours almighty God, now and forever. Amen. And now with the confidence of the children of God, let us pray, Our Father Who Art in Heaven"
" I'd be thy name, thy kingdom, come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us. Our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but Deliver Us from Evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen."
" This morning as we come to receive these elements in the Eucharist invite you to come by the center aisle, there is hand sanitizer to napkin. You might wish to place in your hand and then we will dip the bread into the cup for you and give it to you. If you need gluten-free bread, are Fred is not glue."
" Free. But we do have that option. If you'll come to this side and let me know that you need gluten-free, we will be glad to serve you in that manner that we come together and feast at this table that Christ. Our Lord has prepared to us and invites us to share with him."
 Gracious God we give you thanks for this holy meal and would you share yourself with us tangibly? Reminding Us in the breaking of this bread and the sharing of this cup that you are alive and risen and with us that your love and your forgiveness for us is Everlasting new and fresh every morning.
" Help hours to be as well, in the Name of Christ. Our Lord we pray. Amen. Would you stand to receive this dismissal with blessing?"
 As you go forth from this place.
 Would you remember how much God loves you?
" He doesn't care about the zits, or the big nose, or the big feet, or the little hands or anything else. He loves you, Just the Way You Are."
" He loves you when your clothes, he loves you when you run away."
" He loves you. When you do ride, he loves you when you do wrong."
 He encourages us.
" To always do, right? And to love each other."
" So as you go forth from this place, would you go and look for the good in your neighbor rather than seeing that aggravating person who just pulled out in front of you? Would you try to think surely? There's more to the story than you just saw and witnessed."
 And find something good about everybody.
 because God has
" And may we see each other. As God sees us, let us go forth. Brothers and Sisters. Still love in the love. Well, because we have been loved Well Bar, father,"
" In the name of the father, in the name of the son, in the name of the holy spirit. Amen."
"The grace and peace of the Risen Christ, be with you. The Risen Christ is with us. So good to see you this morning and welcome to Greensboro First United Methodist Church. And we are delighted that you are here and we are delighted that some of you are joining us via livestream or watching us later on recorded video. Thank you for your presence and for your participation in this time of worship. And it's good to have the"
"Cherish back side by side, it's also good. You'll find hymnals underneath your chairs to use this morning during our worship service. So thank you for that. Another thing you'll find is at the end of your row you'll find it a little black pad that has a registration attendance in it. And so if you will please find that and register your attendance and be sure, it gets past all the way down your row. So that everybody who's sitting on your row can register their tend to settle be great."
" Eight. And then this morning during the offering time, we're asking whichever end that ends up on. Will you please pull that first sheet off and bring it with you and place it in the offering place as offering of our attendance as well as our monetary gifts during our time of worship?"
" Today is also Native American Ministry, Sunday in the United Methodist Church. And when you support Native American Ministry studies with your offering, you equip Seminary students, who will honor and celebrate Native American culture, and their Ministries. And you also Empower congregations that are finding fresh and new ways to minister to their communities with the love of Christ. So offering envelopes are available out in the Gathering area on the round table. If you"
" Didn't pick up one as you were coming in, please. You can use one anytime and send that to the church office or this morning. If you want to just Mark, your checkered envelope Native, American Ministries Sunday that will suffice and will be sure that it gets there."
 Will you join me as we pray together?
" The gracious and loving God, we see what law of you have poured upon us and calling us the children of God."
 What we will be is still in process and not fully complete.
" Yet, we are growing in Perfection of love and we are certain that when Christ appears we shall be like him."
" So be patient with us and as we worship this stage, draw us closer to you and to each other and to all the world knowing that our salvation and our righteousness is found in Christ alone. In the Name of Christ. We pray on them."
" Our Salter this morning comes from psalm for it's in your Hymnal and page number 741, the words are will be on the screen. They're a little different but the sun response you'll find there at 7:41 in your him though. The response goes like this."
 With faith. That is all.
" Answer me when I cry out my righteous. God, how long you people will? My reputation be insulted? No, this the Lord takes personal care of the faithful."
 The Lord will hear me when I cry out just this is all so be afraid and don't send bring righteous offerings.
" Many people will say, we can't find goodness anywhere but you have filled my heart with more joy than when they're weak and wine are everywhere."
" So I don't know about you but I love mr. Rogers and when mr. Rogers would come to the end of his show, he would always close with this song and some version of these words."
" Such a good feeling to know you're alive. It's such a happy. Be feeling growing inside. And when you wake up ready to say, I think I'll make a happy good day. It's such a good feeling, a very good feeling the feeling, you know that we're friends and then he would"
" You can know that you can always help to make each day a special day by just being yourself, you grow in your own way everyone does. And that's one reason each one of us is different and special and people can like us, exactly. As we are it's such a good feeling."
" Feeling to know you're alive. It's such a happy feeling you're growing inside. And when you wake up ready to say I think I'll make a Snappy new day. It's such a good feeling, a very good feeling the feeling, you know that I'll be back when the day is done and I'll have more"
" Or ideas for you and your house things you'll want to talk about, I will too. You always make each day a special day. You know how by just being you, there is only one person in the whole world. Exactly. Like you that's you yourself and people can like you exactly"
" Exactly. As you are, it's such a good feeling, a very good feeling the feeling you know that we're friends and Mister Rogers Mantra was I like you just the way you are the phrase. I love you consists of a one letter word."
" A four-letter, word, love and a three-letter word, you 143 a 143. Did you know that a hundred forty? Three pounds was the weight that Mister Rogers cap throughout his adult life a hundred and forty three pounds. And did you know that the governor of Pennsylvania marked May 23rd, or declared May 23rd as a day to honor? Fred Rogers?"
 Because it is the 140 third day of the year. Providing there's no leap year.
" And so the May 23rd is a day to honor, Fred Rogers, his message of love and kindness and generosity and thoughtfulness to others."
" So first John begins with the author announcing that they have been living, what they preach and preaching, what they heard. So that all may have fellowship with them."
" and that is the good news of Easter and the good news of the Christian faith that we are continuing to Proclaim many many, many years later, the fellowship that they were talking about and that they had with one another and that they were inviting others to be a part of, is the fellowship or the relationship where the Koinonia or the communion, or the law of that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit share among the godhead in to"
" That relationship into that communion into that, love the writer of First. John found himself, found all Christians and we're inviting the whole world to realize that we are in this relationship, invited into it by God and a part of it. And in this Fellowship, there is great joy. It's such a good feeling to know you're alive and growing inside growing in"
" This relationship with God, or as the writer of First, John would put it. See what kind of love the father has given us and that we should be called God's children and that is what we are now. Dear friends. Now, we are God's children and it hasn't yet appeared what we will be. Fred Rogers, obviously knew this verse Fred Rogers. Joy was one of relationship with God."
" And others realizing that he and all of us are children of God, that we are brothers and sisters with one another that we are friends as Jesus called as friends of God and Friends of each other."
 And do you know that there's absolutely nothing you can do?
" About that. Even if you don't like somebody you can't not make them your brother and sister, they are like it or not. They are like it or not. That's who we all. Are we are brothers and sisters. We are friends of God, Dorothy us of Gaza taught about the circle. That's kind of like the one up on the screen right now."
 And in this circle dorothea's.
 An ancient father of the church said that God is like that Center Circle that center part.
" And God is light. And in him there is no Darkness. The writer of First John says God is love the first writer of First. John says and God is forever. So the light of God and the love of God, for all creation is an eternal thing and Humanity are all the little lines that are growing out of that Circle."
 Like a wheel with spokes.
" With Humanity being the spokes, all around the diagram."
 And Dorothy is sad. Here's how it is. The father away. You are from God. The Father away. You are from others.
" But the closer you get to others, the closer, you get to God, and the closer you get to God, the closer you get to each other."
 Wow. And it's actually a witness.
 You want to talk about your relationship with God and how close or far away? You are.
 What's your relationship with others?
 All others.
 Do you realize that you are a child of God? If you do? Do you also realize? So is everybody else?
 You didn't do anything to get to be born. A child of God. It's a gift. It's Grace.
" and everybody, the people you like the people, you don't like the people, you don't know if you like or dislike their all"
 children of God as well.
" It's just who we are and all humanity is on this circle in this diagram and much of the time when we talk about, are you living in the light or you're living in the darkness, we make it an either-or. And we kind of put it in different containers, and we make it very dualistic."
" and yet, maybe it's not as dualistic as we think sometimes,"
" The fact of the matter is is that it's not like we sometimes think you're either for us or against us, this circle gives us a different way of seeing our relationship with God and with each other because no matter where you are, if you're over on the far, East side of God, or you're on the far, west side of God, it doesn't really matter."
" Because if you change perspectives or you turn to Circle a little bit, 90 degrees, you're going to be north of God, south of God, turn it another 90 degrees and those who are on the west are on the East and those who are on the Eastern, l in the West."
 It doesn't matter where you are on the circle. What matters is have? You turned to look into the circle?
 Do you realize that you are a child of God is? So that is turning towards God. Realizing the relationship with God.
 And thus realizing our relationship with each other.
" Or are you still turned with your back towards the circle? Are you turned towards the light? Are you turn towards the darkness? Are you turned towards love? Are you turn towards something other than love? That's the point. And so, salvation is not about changing places on this circle or diagram. It's all about turning around and facing the center and realizing that we are children of God. And when we turn around, that's what the word. Repent means to turn around."
" Tannoy to turn around to repent, to realize that you are not anything except a child of God and that's all you need to be."
" And as you realize it for yourself, you realize it for others, and you realize that we are all in this Fellowship, we're all in this family, we're all on this love together."
" And in this Fellowship, there is great joy at such a great feeling."
 To know that we are in relationship with each other.
 Part of our turning towards God is realizing and trusting that we are children of God.
" Sin is the thing that keeps us with our backs, turned to go from God and turned rather away from God, sin is when we tried to deny and pretend that we're not really related to God, that we're not children of God, that we're not brothers and sisters of all Humanity."
 I remember as a teenager I came up with this teasing story for my parents I wanted to express to them that I was probably not their son because I was so different from them and I wanted to tell my sister I was not her brother because we were so different from each other.
" So I was born on Christmas morning, in 1970, in the Wheeler County Hospital, which is a small hospital that's now closed used to be in Glenwood, Georgia."
" Am I fabricated story? Was that on that early Christmas morning there obviously, was another couple passing through town and Glenwood trying to get to their Christmas destination and they were with child."
" Kind of sounds like the Christmas story, right. And they stopped in not at the end, but they stopped in at the Wheeler County hospital and they had their baby. And this was back before things like this couldn't happen or was had precautions against it somehow me? And that baby got swapped and my parents took their baby and laughed and I was stuck with them. That was my story. My joking fatigue strategist story"
 But there's no way to deny it.
" If you see my mom and dad, you see too much of them and me."
" And even when I don't want to admit it, my sister took a picture of a receipt this past week and send it to me and her thumb looks exactly like my son."
" You can't deny it, there's just too much of God's DNA and us to deny that we were not created by God. God put God's Own image in US."
 And we cannot live truthfully and authentically saying we're not children of God.
" We cannot live in sin, we have to turn and acknowledge the truth, we know better, it's just too obvious. There's a little bit of God and all of us."
" because who else created us, if God did not"
" sin is also though when we tried to deny that someone else is not in this circle, that somebody else is not a child of God. Sin is manifested in attitudes and actions. When we begin to feel that we have the upper hand because of our piety that we are so close to God and you're obviously not. So I'm a Child of God, you must be a child of the devil or something. I'm living in the light. You must be living in the Darkness."
" But we feel Superior because of our understanding our education, or the way we dress or the our race, our nationality, our gender, or anything else that we choose to divide ourselves with other people and graduate ourselves with other people and compare ourselves."
 Enough of all that.
 We are children.
" And we can't say that we don't do that. Come on, let's be honest. We all do it."
" Matter of fact, the writer of First, John says, you can't say that you don't sin, we all sin, we all divided ourselves. Sometimes we all began to think that we're better than at least somewhat better than some people anyway. Right."
 And that's where we begin to sin.
" And confession is a good place to start. It's good for the soul and when we confess our sins God is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins. We have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ. The righteous who is the expiation for our sins and not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole world for all the children Sons and Daughters of God."
" And the closer we grow to God, the more we confess and repent and get closer to God the closer we get to each other."
" And the closer we get to each other, the closer we get to God and the opposite is also true."
" Dear friends, brothers and sisters. We all have a place at the table. We all have a place at the family of God."
" and we,"
" Are not in control of this table, or this family to decide who's in, and who's out."
" God, who created us?"
" God, who set the table?"
 Has invited all of us.
 Do you realize you're a child of God?
" Do you realize it, that is by grace and what love? God has bestowed upon you to call you such."
 and do you realize the same is true for everybody in this room and for everybody in this world
 That's who we all are.
" So, we don't judge and we don't compare."
" We just remember that story or a dialogue at the end of John's gospel. When Peter asked, Jesus, about another disciples Lord, what about him?"
" And you remember what? Jesus said, if I want him to remain until I come, what difference does that make to you?"
 You must follow me.
 And that's the only thing we're worried about.
 Everybody's on the circle.
" And what we need to be concerned about, is, have we turn to the center?"
" Are we living in the light and in the fellowship, the joy of communion with God as children."
 And see all else's are brothers and sisters. Or are we living somewhere differently?
 And I don't know your heart and you don't know my heart so we can't judge each other.
 All I can do is get as close to the center as I possibly can.
" And to love you with all that, God has given me."
 And that's all we can do any of us towards anyone.
" So, the real question question is, have we turned to the light of God? Are we living in relationship with God? Are we growing closer to God and closer to others?"
 Or are we living with difference?
 And distance.
" We are now the children of God. So let's now be who we are and live into it. And this is the good news that we live and that we preach because it is what we have heard. And it is what has been passed down to us. That God is love that God is light. And in God, there is no Darkness at all. God never denies the truth, but always confesses. Yes. That one is also my child."
 Whom I dearly love.
" And maybe he's talking about you, maybe he's talking about me."
" Or maybe he's talking about the people that we don't know, or the people, that we find very difficult to love. It's all of us, the fellowship and relationship. We have with god. With each other is the source of our deep and abiding Joy of life. So now, dear friends, the writer says, let us remain in relationship to Jesus."
" So that when he appears we can have confidence and not be ashamed in front of him when he comes. And it's such a great feeling to know you're alive, is such a happy feeling we're growing inside. And when we wake up ready to say, I think I'll live in God's love today. It's such a"
" Good Feeling a very good feeling the feeling, you know, that we're friends and even more than friends were brothers and sisters children of God. That's what we are now. So, let us now be it in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Will you pray with me gracious? God, you call us your children. And that's what we are right now. You were children."
 Keep us O Lord from wandering and turning away from you.
 Keep us from denying the truth of Who We Are.
 No better than no worse than just your children. Adored With Love by you. Teach us how to trust you how to love you like little children.
" even in times of trial, which live, surely has enough of"
" use each one to bring new growth and New Life To Us new depth of our understanding of our relationship new joy in knowing that we are in communion with you. And with each other,"
 And keep us from complacency.
" Help us to know what is good and what is evil and to do good. And to stand against that, which harms your creation, all evil, but keep us from judging our neighbor and calling our neighbor evil."
 But help us confess the evil of our own lives.
 And to turn to you.
" Be with us and Deliver Us from hatred and from violence, and four division of All Sorts that our world is filled with."
 And bring your kingdom.
 And help us to love and to be loved just as we are.
 Lord hear our prayers. We pray that you would love the world through us.
 That you would let us love the world through you.
 And that you would help us be loved by you through your world and the name of Christ Our Lord we pray. Amen.
" So Christ, Our Lord invites to his table, all who love him who earnestly repent of their sin and who seek to live in peace with one another."
" Therefore, let us confess our sin before God. And before one another, as we join in this prayer of confession,"
" good and gracious. God, we are creatures of dust ignorant of your Revelation, misunderstanding, your life death, and Resurrection Among Us needing forgiveness. We repent of our failure. To give as you have given to us, we beg your mercy for our fallen world. We seek you word that we may live with the faith of Jesus."
" BR solace in this life and always we ask this as your own children, holy and incomplete, forgive us and lead us."
" In the name of Jesus, the Christ we pray. Amen. If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from All unrighteousness In The Name of Jesus Christ. You are forgiven."
" Glory to God and our men, the Peace of Christ be with you. Amen, this morning, they we offer ourselves as we offer this Bread and Wine and then we offer our Gifts of our attendance. If you'll please bring those registration pad attendances with you and with our monetary gifts, that we may practice the giving of ourselves that our lives might truly be lived. In generosity, proclaiming the good news that we have."
 Heard and that we have witnessed and that we dare to preach to the whole world. Let us come and let us offer as the choir offers their gift of music.
" Gracious. God thank you for the gifts that you give us the gift of yourself, the gift of relationship and love the gift of being your children."
" Help us now to turn loose and not to hoard the gifts, you share with us."
" But to offer ourselves, these monetary gifts, the gift of our presence, the gift of our availability, to all that you would desire to do through us, that your kingdom may come. And that the whole world may know who we truly are, who they truly are, who we truly are together even now and forever for. We pray this in the way that Jesus taught us saying Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name,"
" The kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us. Our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but Deliver Us from Evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen."
 Will you please remain standing for the prayer of the great Thanksgiving?
 The Lord be with you.
 Lift up your hearts.
" Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God."
" It is right in a good, A Joyful thing, always. And everywhere to give thanks to you almighty, God, creator of Heaven and Earth. Your throne is surrounded by a multitude of angels and living creatures. That praise your Holy Name forever. And so with your people on Earth and all the company of Heaven, We Praise Your Name and join their unending hymn. Holy, holy, holy Lord. God of power and might Heaven and Earth are full of your glory."
" Hosanna in the highest blessed. Is he? Who comes in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest? Holy are you in blessed? Is your son Jesus Christ. He redeemed Saul on the road to Damascus, making him a witness to all that you had done and all that was yet to come"
" Jesus healed, the sick, he raised the dead, he cast out demons and the brief time that he was with us, Jesus sided with the oppressed had compassion for those who suffer and gave dignity to women and children. He taught us in word and deed about a God who had been unable. We had been unable to understand"
" And in spite of his glory, revealing presence among us. We turned him into a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief."
" Jesus was persecuted by certain religious leaders and betrayed by one of his own. He was lied about tortured and hung on a cross to die yet, even on the day of his crucifixion. Jesus continued to teach those who would listen when evil people came with his betrayer. Jesus did not respond with violence. Choosing instead to remind us that those who live by the sword will die by the sword."
" When he was falsely accused and condemned to death, Jesus refused to do harm. And while hanging on the cross, he prayed, father, forgive them for they know not what they do."
" But we give you, thanks that nothing ever was or ever will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, our lord and early on the third day, Jesus, laughed at death. He shed his grave clothes and walked Among Us Alive. 40 days later he ascended into heaven, where he is seated, at the right hand of God, of our ancestors, our eyes are turned towards the skies, looking for the day when Jesus shall return to whether a kingdom Without End."
" Where the lion will lie down peaceably with the lamb where sickness and disease are not known where the wicked will cease from troubling and we will study war, no more on the night in which he gave himself up for us. He took bread"
" He gave, thanks to you."
" He broke the bread, he gave it to his disciples and said, take eat. This is my body, which is given for you do this in remembrance of me."
" And when the supper was over, he took the cup. He gave thanks to you. He gave it to his disciples and said, drink from this. All of you. This is my blood of the New Covenant poured out for you, and for many, for the Forgiveness of sins do this, as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. And so in remembrance of these, your Mighty acts in Jesus Christ, we offer ourselves and praise, and thanksgiving as a holy and Living Sacrifice in Union with Christ offering for us."
" As we proclaim, the mystery of Faith Christ has died. Christ is risen. Christ will come again. Pour out your Holy Spirit on us, gathered here. And on these gifts of bread and wine, make them be for us, the body, and blood of Christ that we might be for the world. The body of Christ Redeemed by his blood wonder-working. God, pour out your spirit upon us, as we offer ourselves to be God's presence in the world until"
" Jesus returns in glory. And by your spirit, make us one with Christ. One with each other and one in Ministry to all the world until Christ comes and final Victory. And we Feast at his heavenly banquet through your son, Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit, in your holy church, all honor and glory is yours almighty God now and forever."
 Amen.
" This morning as we celebrate the Eucharist, please let us observe these instructions. If you don't feel comfortable sharing, Holy Communion during this pandemic, we understand. And so does God"
" If you do not wish to come forward to receive the sacrament, you can just simply remain in your seat or you can come forward and just cross your chest with your arms and we will give you a blessing instead, the ushers will direct us and they'll ask us to please come by this side. There will be two stations, you can stop at the first one or go to the sacko, and if that's available."
" When you come, there's hand sanitizing stations, and a tissue that you can place in your hand, we will dip the bread in the cup for you and then place it in your hands for social distancing. We ask that you would not kneel at the altar but if you feel you just must please observe, social distancing with others. Who are there as well, our bread this morning is not gluten-free but we do have gluten-free bread available in a separate chalice. Available view will indicate"
 To come that you need such. We will be delighted to serve you that you're invited to join with the choir and singing as others are receiving the sacrament and let us rejoice and know that great joy that we are in communion at this table.
 With God through Christ.
 And with each other.
" and with all the world,"
 The like the element eat.
 I see no one.
" Let us pray gracious, God?"
" Thank you for this gift of your holy meal that sustains. Our faith reminds us of how loved we are and reminds us to go forth from this table to be Christ and to love your world that they are certain to know the truth. They are a child of God, loved by you and in relationship and fellowship with all of us."
" Dear Lord, help our world to begin to practice this truth as we, your church or more faithful to share it in the Name of Christ. Our Lord we pray. Amen."
Good morning.
Good morning.

Rob."
 Good morning this past week. Mark the appointment of clergy in the United Methodist Church for the coming church year and we were notified by our district superintendent. That Pastor Matt has been reappointed to our church for this coming church here. So please join me in recognition of past the match.
 Good morning.
" Wonderful things are happening here in Greensboro, United Methodist Church and I'm thrilled and excited to tell you about a new committee that we have formed. Seeing the need to help feed the hungry in our community. A core group of our members has formed a soup kitchen committee. Our mission is to provide Christ centered services to our local community."
" Feeding the hungry with dignity and compassion. Everyone is welcome. Regardless of race religious beliefs or financial resources. We have been in close contact with the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer. On Main Street, they have been supplying, a free lunch, a cold lunch for about a year and a half. Now, once a month and they are feeding about 40."
" Five to eighty five people each month, we've also been in contact with the Presbyterian church on Main Street. That is right next to the post office and they just started this month with a hot lunch that they're providing for the community."
" The Presbyterian Church has taken the first Saturday of the month, and the Episcopal church has taken the third Saturday of the month. So it is our plan to start with the second Saturday of each month. Starting on Saturday, June, the 12th from 11 to 1. At our North Campus, we will furnish a sandwich soup chips desert and the"
" Piece of fruit. We will be setting up in the Breezeway between the church and the Family Life Center and we will be giving out a bag. Lunch, we are very blessed. We have had a local charitable organization that has pledged to fund our soup kitchen for now."
 So we want to start out in a small way but our vision is for one day to have a real soup kitchen a place where sit-down meals are served and the body as well as the soul is nourished so that no one goes away hungry or without hope. So what do we need? We need you. We have to have volunteers to make this a success.
" We need people to make the desserts cooking, the soup on Friday and help on Saturday making sandwiches begging the desert assembly the bag. Lunches, we need men to set up the table and take it down and we also need help with the publicity. Now we already have a publicity chairman, but she needs help putting Flyers out in the community each month and would, if someone"
" Really good at writing for the newspaper. We certainly want to have some publicity in the newspaper and pictures and there's all other sorts of things. So after the service, the committee will be out in the north X wearing a red apron to answer any questions you may have and they will have sign up boards. And we also have some sign ups around the round table out in the north X."
" It is our hope that we will get enough volunteers that we will only need to ask you maybe every few months to help serve and help us. Unless you want to come after that. Saturday each month we'll be glad to have you. And we're also looking for anyone who would like to join our committee because we're always open to two more ideas. So with the clothes, I'd like to read a Bible verse from John chapter 6,"
" Verse 35 then Jesus declared I am the bread of life, whoever comes to me will never go hungry and whoever believes in me will never go thirsty. Thank you."
 The grace and peace of the Risen Christ. Be with you. The Risen Christ is with us. Amen. Will you pray with me?
 Great. Shepherd of Oscar sheep.
 We thank you for the way that you truly tend to us so that we have no want.
 you provide cool streams for us to drink and to be refreshed by
 You provide Green Pastures for us to lay down and to find rest.
 You lead us in the past that we should go. That honor you
 You are with us in the darkest and the most dangerous stretches of the journey.
 We praise you for all that you are to us and for your goodness.
" And for your willingness to meet us, even this day in this place."
 Help us with all that we are and with the empowerment of your Holy Spirit within us.
" To worship you and to praise you and to hear yet again your words of life and your words of guidance, this day in the Name of Christ. We pray, amen. You may be seated."
" A reading from first, John chapter 3 verses 16 through 24. This is how we know, love, Jesus laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. But if someone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need, but refuses to help, how can the love of God, dwell in a person like that."
" Little children, let us not love with words or speech, but with action and Truth. This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and reassure our hearts for God's presence. Even in our hearts, if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our hearts and knows. All things, dear friends. If our hearts don't condemn us, we have confidence in relationship to God. We receive whatever we ask from him because we keep his"
" And minutes and do what pleases him. This is his Commandment that we believe in the name of his son. Jesus Christ and love each other. As he has commanded us, those who keep his Commandments dwelleth in God and God, dwells in them. This is how we know that he dwells in us because of the spirit, he has given us the word of the Lord."
" If you're able, would you stand for the reading of the Gospel?"
 The Lord be with you.
 A reading from The Gospel According to st. John.
" Jesus said, I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd, lays down his life, for the Sheep."
" When The Hired Hand sees the wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and runs away, that's because he isn't the shepherd, the Sheep aren't really his. So the wolf attacks, the sheep and scatters them, he's only a Hired Hand and the Sheep. Don't matter to him."
 I am the Good Shepherd. I know my own sheep and Mama and they know me just as the father knows me and I know the father
 I give up my life for the Sheep.
 I have other sheep that don't belong to this sheet pain. I must lead them to
 they will listen to my voice and there will be one flock with one Shepherd.
" This is why the father loves me, I give up my life so that I can take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I give it up because I want to, I have the right to give it up and I have the right to take it up again. I received this commandment from my father, this is the gospel of the Lord."
 Thank you. You may be seated.
" So today is the fourth Sunday of Easter. And the fourth Sunday of Easter is often referred to as Shepherd Sunday, because it's a Sunday in the Christian year, when the lectionary readings, always focus on the fact that Jesus is the Good Shepherd."
" Thus in the gospel lesson that we've just heard Jesus calls himself, the Good Shepherd, and he Compares how he lays down his life for sheep like us for all the world."
" And he does. So in comparison to a Hired Hand, who would not lay down his life for his sheep, but when the Sheep are threatened, The Hired Hand runs away and Jesus says, the reason that a hard hand would do that is because the Sheep don't matter to him."
 They're not really his.
 We continue today. Also our Focus that we are doing during this Easter season on the book of First John and the theme of. So now what the resurrection has happened. So now what and we realize that Easter people now do as Yeezus commanded and why does exactly is it that Jesus commands of Oz
 What is it that marks us as Christian people what is it? That makes us Shepherds of a sheep. Are sheep of a shepherd.
 What is that?
" Well, the writer of First John joins with several other scripture Riders and saying that this is what Jesus commands, it's in two parts. The first is that we entrust Our Lives to Jesus that, we believe what he says that we believe him."
 And the second is that we would love each other.
 Those are the two Commandments. Those are the two things that Mark us is Christian people. Those are the two things that we are all about.
" Of course, the next question always is, but what does it mean to love people?"
 What does love look like?
" Well, as Mike Morgan would say I'm glad you asked that question."
" Because the writer of First, John answers it for us."
 This is how we know love.
 Jesus laid down his life for us.
 And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.
 That's love.
" Love is to me raw Jesus in our lives because as the writer will say later in this book, God is love."
" To love our brothers and sisters is to mirror the very being of God to them. The God, we know, the God, we have come to know. The god that we understand that loves us so Easter people that we are, we entrust Our Lives to Jesus the Christ realizing that we are the children of God. And as such as sheep and the Sheep pen, we are called to be for our neighbor."
" Just as Jesus is for us to be a Shepherd to them just as easy as his to us to care about them and not be like a Hired Hand to them, but to realize that we truly are our Brother's Keeper. We are our Sister's Keeper. We are Neighbor's Keeper."
" And that's what distinguishes us, they will know that we are Christians."
 Bar love.
" Earlier this month, you have probably heard the story and some of you may even have known very well Kim. McGrady from Dunwoody"
 Kim was walking along the beach when he heard people yelling from the water.
 He jumped in and saved three people before he drowned himself.
" He literally did what Jesus showed us. Kim exemplified love of neighbor by allowing his compassion, and his concern, for his neighbor. Being his Neighbor's, Keeper to override his very strong Instinct that we all have for self-preservation."
" He laid down his life literally, for his neighbors."
" Neighbors, whose names he didn't even know."
 But he saw a neighbor and need a brother and sister in trouble and he did what he could do.
 And he put his own safety at risk in hopes of maybe saving another.
" And another rescue on Panama City Beach recently, multiple people risk their lives to form a human chain and to reach out into the water to rescue more persons, who were caught in a Riptide."
" If you think about a human chain, what a beautiful image of the church, the body of Christ, then how we cooperate with one another and how we join hands and arms and locked together, realizing that we can do even Greater Works of love when we work together."
 And we can love our neighbors even better than we can as just individuals.
 But why do such why put one's own life in jeopardy?
 Why deny one their life? Why deny a family and espouse their spouse and a father?
 Why do that?
" Some people would call that crazy. Some people would call that irresponsible, some people would call that a lot of different things and just not understand."
" But we Easter people, we children of God, we sheep of the pastor of the Good Shepherd, we understand. Because once we believe Jesus,"
" And we are certain that we are the children of God, whom God loves and watches over as a Shepherd figure for us."
 Then we just mirror of what we know.
 We mirror to the world. What we have experienced in Christ.
 We mirror for the world.
" the one who calls us his children, The God Who is for us and with us and in US,"
 And and love is not something that we do on our own love is God.
 It is mirroring the god that we know to the world.
" And this is how we know law of, we just do like Jesus did and he lay down his life for us and we lay down our lives, for our neighbors. And we don't run like Hired Hands, who run out of the lack of concern and another lack of compassion. Instead, we mirror the Good Shepherd who is full of love, who is always for us? Who is always there with us?"
 And who abides in US?
" But laying on our lives, doesn't just mean that we do one heroic act in a lifetime of giving our lives to someone or something. Instead the rider first, John makes it fairly clear that when we see a neighbor a brother or a sister and they're in need"
 and remember Jesus taught us who our neighbor was everybody.
" We don't run like Hired Hands when we see a neighbor in need, instead, we put love into action because love is not just an emotion, or a feeling of compassion, it is law of enacted."
 And we lay down our lives for our neighbors.
" Gail Iker has just shared with us about the ministry of the food bank, how exciting. And many of you have already signed up to help with that and, and many more, I know will sign up to help with that this morning and thank you for that."
" And the food bank is just one way of how our hearts are open to respond to our neighbors in love that if we have a neighbor who needs something and we can do something about that, we do it because well that's just who we are. That's the kind of Shepherd we follow. That's the kind of God, we know,"
 And we mirror that.
" When we see our neighbor in need we act, we love we witness that we are in this together. As children of God, with all of God's children,"
 We mirror God's love as we share a meal as we pull up a chair and offer not only just food but that we offer also fellowship and relationship and love of our neighbor who's in need and we reflect God's love.
 We reflect the Good Shepherd who lays down his life and we do the same.
" We take the time we take the effort, we even put ourselves in places of, that's not so comfortable."
 So that our neighbors might know.
 That we care.
 That we care for who they are and we care about them.
" So we lay down our lives, for our neighbors, by sharing our resources, our finances, our food, our time, our conversation, our advocacy are true, compassion and care. That's real. And that's true. And we love our neighbor as if they were our self."
 What would we want people to do if we were in the same situation? How would we want people to treat us and relate to us?
" We'd be thankful. If they hand us some food, we would be even more thankful if they would share that food with us and really care about us and get to know us."
" This is Love and this is what sets us apart from the world that runs like Hired Hands and preserving, one's own life with little regard for their neighbors life."
" And what the world has always needed. As the song says, is law of true love."
 For without love life of others become. So devalued and South.
 Become so self-evaluate or South valuation becomes so inflated.
" without love hearts clothes and compassion and Care become rare while self-interest becomes ubiquitous along with bitterness and anger, and deep degrees of hatred,"
" The need of neighbors, not a dress. But instead is countered with jealousy and fear, that someone might actually receive something they didn't deserve."
" And jealousy and anger, and bitterness, and self-interest and degrees of hatred leads to acts of violence and the taking of life."
 Taking the life of another.
 Has become just an everyday occurrence in our society.
 We just don't value our neighbor.
" And while we debate about where gun control crosses, the line to the right to bear arms, we fail to recognize what truly is missing."
 Where is love?
 Where is compassion?
 Where is that kind of Shepherd - that our Shepherd showed us and exemplified for us.
" And said, as I have loved you, you are to love each other."
 What the world needs?
 Is last hard hands.
" And more embodiment enactment of the love of the Good Shepherd, who lays down his life for others. This is our call. This is Who We Are."
" We've entrusted Our Lives to the Christ who loves us so much and we love each other. We love all others in the way that we have been loved and so while the world chooses to hate and while the world chooses to turn a blind eye to Injustice, while the world continues to be fanatical about my rights, my freedoms, my pleasure, while the world continues to devour each other, and devour another before they devour you,"
" Why the world continues to not allow compassion to motivate acts of self? Giving love the body of Christ is different. We are a people who are different because we are always doing just the opposite refusing to turn our heads refusing to pretend it's not, we are a people who love and we are a people who care and the world just doesn't understand that because they don't, yet know the shepherd. And so they don't understand the Sheep but once we convince them that they are part of this same sheet."
" Pain and that the same Shepherd who cares for us, cares for them. And they witnessed that through our tangible Acts."
 The world begins to change the world becomes transformed as Jesus Promised.
 And folks is really all that matters.
" We get so tied up as Christians sometimes and what's good and what's bad and what's real and what's not and and yet the only thing that matters is love, I mean code the rider of Galatians have said it any stronger or any better for in Christ Jesus. He said neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything. The only thing that counts is Faith working through, love nothing else matters."
" Pretend We're people of faith if we will, but if we don't know how to love, we don't know the shepherd."
" And if we do know how to love, even if we claim, we don't know. The shepherd, we certainly must do."
 because he's reflected in our very being
 if our faith is working through love.
" And if the love of Jesus, the kind of love that lays down, one's life, for another is being lived out in US."
 And that is what God is observing.
 That is what God is witnessing.
 And that is what our lives are reflecting and witnessing to the world.
" and the writer of First, John says that when we keep these Commandments of trusting Our Lives to Jesus and loving each other,"
 God will help us.
 Because it's not easy.
" Oh, it's difficult to love people, sometimes."
 It's not easy.
 It's easy to love those who love you back. Jesus sad.
 But it's really difficult to love those who are indifferent to you.
" And even worse, those who would do you harm?"
" But that's where Christian love begins to shine forth as not just a kind of love, but real love."
 And when we are striving to keep those Commandments God will help us.
 We will receive whatever we ask. So long as we're asking for help to love our neighbors better.
 To love our neighbors as we love ourselves.
 God will help us.
" And this is our witness that God, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The one who's forest with us. And in US is truly at the center of our Lives because we are loving"
" And we're loving better today than yesterday, and we will love better tomorrow than even today."
" And when we say, we love we put that love into action."
 By being willing to lay our lives down.
 That others may have life.
 So brothers and sisters.
 Follow sheep of the sheep pen.
 Let us grow in our witness and in love for each other. And for all the world because this is the main thing.
 And let's always keep the main thing. The main thing among us.
" And as our witness to all the world and the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we pray. Amen. Will you pray with me?"
 Gracious. God we give witness and testimony this today to all the world and to each other and to even ourselves that we have been love very well.
" You have not withheld yourself from us in any way, but you have given yourself to us."
 And continue to give yourself to us.
 In ways that just cannot be described with words but that are just truly amazing.
" No matter how bad a sheet, we are, how how rebellious we are."
" Your love for us, never ends."
" when we stray, and when we run away at any point in time, we turn around you are standing there with open arms to receive us and invite us and to celebrate"
 That the one who is lost has come home.
 Gracious. God.
 Will you please help us to reflect the love that we have experienced in you to each other?
 Would you help us to stay in the places where we are still broken and hurting in the places that we are in need?
" and the places that we have been oppressed,"
" and the places where we grieve places, where we don't understand what's going on,"
 Thank you for your faithfulness to be our Good Shepherd.
" Not to run away from us, but to run to us."
 And to help us.
 The ways you help us help our neighbor. Would you help our neighbor through us?
" If we are the source of their hurt or the source of their oppression or the source of just their frustrations, would you help us?"
 To stop.
" And instead of shortening, and instead of running away, would you just fill us with a compassion and a love like yours."
 That is yours.
 And help our neighbors through us.
 Would you teach us how to be a better church? More? Loving Church.
 Your church in all the world.
 Would you teach our world how to be a better Humanity?
 A more loving people.
 That did not focus so much on those things that divide us and separate us and makes us different.
 But that celebrates our diversity.
 And calls us to truly love and care. Not in words or feelings only but in action. And in truth
 Dear Lord. This is our prayer. This is our true hearts desire.
 Would you help us?
 For it is in the Name of Christ. Our Lord we pray. Amen.
" So, does anybody ever get aggravated with mask?"
" Christ, Our Lord invites to his table, all who love him who earnestly, repent of their sin and who seek to live in peace with one another. If we're honest with ourselves, our heart condemn us"
" But God, who knows everything is greater than our own hearts and God's deep desire for us as mercy and love and peace. Therefore, let us confess our sin."
" Lord have mercy on us. We talk about love but our actions betray us we talk about love but we neglect the poor. We talk about love but we fail to love one. Another Lord have mercy on us, forgive us and abide in Us by the power of your Holy Spirit."
 So that our Lives May show our love for Jesus Christ in whose body we live and in whose name we pray.
" And all the people said we seek God's grace with boldness because we trust in Jesus Christ. The one who loves us and laid down his life for us. The good news of the Gospel, is this in the name of Jesus Christ, you are forgiven."
" Glory to God and our men, the Peace of Christ. Be with you this morning, as we offer, are tangible offerings to Christ. We ask you to bring those forward, into place them in the baskets that are here on the kneeling rail."
" Please do that. As we hear this offering of music from our choir,"
 I should.
 Extreme evil.
 We please remain standing if you are able for the prayer of the great Thanksgiving.
 The Lord be with you lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord. Our God.
" It is right in a good and joyful thing always and everywhere to give our thanks and praise o, God to you, you are Our Shepherd and we lack nothing that we need. You got is two Springs of Living Water. You comfort us when Afflicted and Grant peace to our souls, you tend us with goodness and love and so with your people on Earth and all the company of Heaven, We Praise Your Name and join their unending hymn."
" Holy holy, holy Lord, God of power and might Heaven and Earth are full of your glory hosanna in. The highest blessed. Is he who comes in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest? Holy are you and blessed is your son Jesus Christ. He is the Good Shepherd, he knows his flock and we know him when he was cast into death dark Valley, you raised him to New Life. Now, he lives forever and Shepherds. All"
" Look to You for salvation. You wipe the tears from our eyes and spread a table before us so that we might feed forever from your abundant goodness and hunger and thirst No More. By the baptism of his suffering, death and Resurrection, you gave birth to your church, delivered Us From Slavery to sin and death and made with us. A new covenant by water and the spirit."
" On the night in which he gave himself up for us. Jesus Took bread, gave thanks to you broke the bread and gave it to his disciples and said, take eat. This is my body, which is broken and given for you. Do this in remembrance of me and when the supper was over, he took the cup. He gave thanks to you. He gave it to his disciples and said, drink from this. All of you for this is my blood of the New Covenant poured out for you and for many, for the Forgiveness of sins do this, as often as,"
" You drink it in remembrance of me. And so in remembrance of these, your Mighty acts in Jesus Christ, we offer ourselves and praise and thanksgiving as a holy and Living Sacrifice in Union with Christ offering for us as we proclaim the mystery of Faith Christ has died. Christ is risen. Christ will come again. Pour out your Holy Spirit on us, gathered here. And on these gifts of bread and wine, making them be for us, the body and blood"
" blood of Christ that we may be for the world. The body of Christ Redeemed by his blood, by your spirit, make us one with Christ, one with each other and one in Ministry to all the world until Christ comes and final Victory. And we Feast at the heavenly banquet through your son, Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit, in your holy church, honor and glory is yours almighty God, now and forever."
" And with the confidence of the children of God, we pray, Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us. Our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil. For thine is the kingdom"
 And the power and the glory forever.
 You may be seated.
" As we celebrate the Eucharist today, please let us observe these instructions. If you do not yet feel comfortable, sharing a meal in this time of pandemic, we understand. And God understands. If you do not wish to receive, you may just remain seated or you. Matt come with your arms crossed across your chest and we will just bless you. The ushers will give us directions coming by the center aisle, and returning to our seat on the sides as they"
" Come are as they give direction. If you cannot come, if you will let them know that will be glad to bring two elements to you in your seat. When you do come there sanitizing stations here to sanitize your hands to take a tissue and put in your hands if you wish and then as you come with Open Hands to the station we will dip a piece of bread in the juice and place it in your hands. And that way, our bread is not gluten-free. However, if you want gluten-free bread, if you"
" You'll come to this station and let me know. We'll be glad to serve you the gluten-free chalice and bread for social distancing purposes, please don't come and kneel at the altar. If you feel that you just must do that, please observe social distancing with others who are dealing and praying and let us join together and singing with the choir as others are receiving this sacrament."
 Gracious. God.
 Thank you for this table.
" For this meal, by which we are fed."
" not only of our physical being with physical bread, but"
 Where our faith in your love and in your grace is renewed and strengthened and deepened.
 And enable us to arise from this table of love.
 And to go and witness and mirror such love to all the world and the name of Christ we pray. Amen.
 Would you receive a stand to receive this dismissal with blessing?
" So brothers and sisters. We are so blessed to be loved, so dearly and graciously and mercifully by God."
" Just go forth from this place and as you live your life mirror, what you have witnessed in God and lay down your life for others. Just as Christ has laid his life down for you. And let us truly be Christ to this world in the name of the father, in the name of the son, in the name of the holy spirit. Amen."
"Good morning. This is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. The Lord be with you. We're glad you're here for worship on this the fourth Sunday at the Easter season, is good to have you all here for this service today. I did want to make one kind of big announcement to just. Make sure we're all clear about it. Today is the last day that we're actually Gathering monies for the Lake. Oconee scholarship with the"
" Youth Alliance. And so as we don't know, we kind of shifted in the youth Alliance, they have their own board of directors. Now and so we have a header organizational shift with it and we are seeking to have a scholarship at lf-cc scholarship at the youth Alliance is so today is less data, we're collecting monies course, I'm sure if Monday or Tuesday Linda, we can still, if my dear Tuesday, the check gets here, that is fine. But if you're on the internet watching us and haven't made the contribution, we do."
" She ate you coming making a contribution here if for some reason you went ahead and send it directly to the youth Alliance. That's fine. I mean that's a okay but if you wanted it credit to the lf-cc, you need to make contact with the youth Alliance and let them know that you wanted it to be a part of this scholarship. So help us out, you know, just appreciate your generosity and that area because it goes 12 good gun people. If you've not had a chance to meet some of the young people that are going through this"
" Scholarship program. There really are outstanding so so really gives you hope for the future when you need kids like that. So that you could be a part of that. We do want to continue to be prayer. Covid-19 conversation before worship the spikes that are occurring in India and Japan or or disconcerting. I realize it's not the United States. And thank God, you know the vaccines as tough, a big going through our country to where it looks like, at least it's tempering a spike, its kind of keeping a spike down"
" Looks like, and so, very blessed that we've had that opportunity. Other places have not been as fortunate, Indian Japan or two of those devices at the moment. And so we want to definitely be in prayer for those stomachs and being prayer for those who are suffering from covid in this country, seems like more and more. Young people are the ones that are now in the hospital. So it has shifted from being an older adult disease to now young adult that are they're ending up in the hospital."
" And then the long-term consequences were still not aware of, and still don't know what the long-term pieces would be so strong / concerns for that. And so let's continue to pray. And that way, it's good to have you here at worship today."
" Scripture takes today comes from The Gospel. According to John, the 10th chapter verses 11 to 18. He'll be reading from the common English. Bible lessons are read from the word of God. I am the Good Shepherd, the Good Shepherd, lays it down, lays down his life for the Sheep. When The Hired Hand sees the wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and runs away, that's because he isn't the shepherd, the Sheep aren't really."
" Is so the wolf attacks, the sheep and scatters them. He's only a Hired Hand and the Sheep. Don't matter to him. I'm Good Shepherd. I know my own sheep and they know me just as the father knows me and I know the father give up my life for the Sheep. I have other sheep that don't belong to this sheep pen. I'm asleep them. Also they will listen to my voice and there will be one flock with one Shepherd."
" This is why the father loves me, I give up my life so that I can take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I give it up because I want to, I have the right to give it up and I have the right to take it up again. I received this commandment for my father, this is word of God for the people of God, and we said, thanks. Be to God as we know our time of prayer meditation. I invite each of us to take a moment of silence, giving us a chance to reflect on our lives to see"
" The concerns of our hearts are too late, those before God. And the dear God, still small voice speaking directly to each and every one of us, then I'll leave us in the community prayer and then we'll close with the Lord's Prayer. So, let us bow."
" We've got the once again of God in this place to come and to worship you today, Lord. As we look at this 10th chapter of John here in the lectionary readings, for today, we're reminded that we are part of sheep herd and being part of the sheep. Herd, we have a Shepherd who's watching after us. And so, oftentimes the image of the Shepherd in the scriptures, remind us that were being taken care of. So, no matter what,"
" Happening in this world and things that make us very anxious and raise our anxiety levels, whatever may be going on personally in our own lives, or as a society, whether in this country or in the world, the concerns that we see all around us. Lord, he can, it can make us truly anxious. And we need to be reminded that we really do. Have a Shepherd, we have a good shepherd, shepherd, who's willing to lay down his life for us,"
" So Lord reminds us today, if we come into this service today, worried about all kinds of things, remind us about the shepherd who loves us and takes care of us."
" Wherever we may be leaving, if we pretend to go astray in to stray from the Sheep herd, we do have that shit for the comes and finds us. We're told that the shepherd will leave the 99 and come find the one, the one who is going out roaming and his lost their way, it's so remind us Lord. That if we're feeling like, we don't know. The way, we don't know what the future holds. We don't know what directions we need to take. We aren't sure which choices when you to choose. Lord need for feeling, just the the way."
 Eat of all of that.
 Reminds us that there is one that is looking after us.
 And thank God. We are don't have to rely just on ourselves.
" So help us to be good sheep in the midst of the shepherding experience, may we listen for the shepherd's Voice. May we follow the shepherd's voice."
" May we allow the shepherd to lead us into the past and the directions that we need to go. So there were living this life in all its fullness and living it as you had attended us to do. We pray all of this, in the name of Jesus. The one who taught us to pray, Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses."
" As we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. One of the marks of the 21st century so far at least in these first 20 years has been an increase in anxiety among people of all walks of life."
" Just take a look at what there is to be anxious about it. The moment think about all we go through, we've, we've had changed economic situations around the world and even here in America but the good and the bad in people suffering. In varieties of way, we have watched pressure. Be placed on industry and prices. We're now beginning to see prices of everyday essential items. Beginning to rise. All of a sudden anxiety, over. Inflation has begun. Once again, we watch him."
" Pray, you know, it's the market sometimes bounces back and forth and we're not sure how it all goes, but we're anxious that before everything. Settles we tend to be anxious. And for some of this is we folks and folks have dealt with insecurity of jobs. Those whom retirement don't have to worry about that anymore. But there are a lot of people who are feeling anxious because the insecurities of their jobs, they're waiting and anticipating the announcement of"
" You know, employment terminated or they continuing to be laid off or they can be rehired, is to being cut back, will the company be liquidated? We're seeing that a lawn in the Athens area job security security important in the, in Past Times it was taken for granted. Oh I would have this job for the next 30 years or so but the possibility of no job and of retraining for another job but it's a cause of anxiety and awful lot of people these days."
" We're going to have to be retrained for other jobs and that's a source of anxiety. Oh, and the changes in moral values. The fact that there's not a consistent guide these days in the way, people should behave toward other people. It races the anxiety. People do their own thing without any consideration of the consequences of the well-being of others."
" And what's the result? Well, the result is security systems and our own sand lines of vehicles picking up, children after school and the reluctance to travel on public transport at nighttime and children, no longer playing without Supervision in the park. Most of us grew up without that supervision didn't wait. And yet, we dare let children these days. Be without Supervision in the park lockdowns, practice of lockdowns, in school,"
 Can you imagine none of us had to go through that? But children today have to go through the lockdown just in preparation for the day when their lives are in danger.
 Anxiety. You bet that younger generation has tremendous levels of anxiety. And you wonder why?
" The change in the level of security and safety on the world scene. Braces are anxiety levels as well. Just the increase awareness of terrorism, whether its domestic terrorism or terrorism from abroad. We, you know, here in America, we've been isolated for so long from that kind of thing happening. When would see it in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Africa, and elsewhere. But all of a sudden it's here and it's a possibility here, whatever happened they are penetrated into our"
" Society for those who would seek to do harm and to do death. So, being in fear of being at the wrong place at the wrong time and being the victim of an act of terrorism has been a source of anxiety, the fear of shootings in schools, you know, that happen, elsewhere. And then, one day could be repeated here. Her that possibility that your behavior, that that would happen all increased anxiety."
 Ayat about our safety and about the safety of our children and our grandchildren.
" And then with the increase in World Travel, we have seen how quickly disease can spread throughout the world covid-19. Of course, it's been this past year in times past bird, flu swine, flu Ebola, others and increases, the awareness of our vulnerability."
 And it increases our anxiety.
" The changes are environment. Oh, I saw a video just this past week, the global warming, it causes folks, to be anxious, especially our children to be anxious. They know, we know about the destruction of those on layer, planetary warming, pollution of water. And are they hear about the possibility of sooner or later that our planet could be hit by a large Ash meteor? Like the one who wiped out the dinosaurs in years past or the possibility that our planet income. So warm"
" and that life on Earth as we know, it will become so so different"
 And then what about the changes in relationships?
" It will bring anxiety in our lives. The fallen out with a family member or a friend, parents, you separate and divorce aggressiveness of people in the workplace and on the roads, and then the keys, all raised, our anxiety, and all this anxiety. And stress, is causing Havoc, Havoc with our confidence."
 Havoc with our health and Havoc with our happiness.
" So let's get real. There seems to be little, we can do about some of the threats that confront Us in these times. We can't, of course, try to minimize the rest. We don't walk alone at night."
" We don't resigned from work without having another job lined up. We do pick up our children and grandchildren after school. We put locks on the windows and the doors, we make sure that the ironed is turned off before leaving the house,"
" We're trying to do our bitch, reduce our impact on the environment. These things are rather like a little child, trying to stop water coming out of the tab by putting their hand, to cover it. With no matter how hard the child tries, the pressure is too great and inevitably the inevitable happens."
" There was one Church notice facing the passing crowd with this kind of advice cheer up. It may never happen because good sign and that's true to a degree. That kind of cheery. Bit of advice, doesn't really help when it's your child who has the symptoms, like covid-19, or your grandchild is caught between feuding parents."
" If you try to make the dollar stretch, just a little bit further, it's not that funny. Surely, as followers of Christ, we would have more to say than just cheer up."
 And hopefully I do today.
" You see a lot of anxiety is tied up with looking ahead and stressing over things, that might happen. And there are times when anxiety grips, our hearts and it deals with fear, and the future, the future seemed so uncertain the future. It seems so, so threatening"
" For the Christian, there is an important ingredient involved with looking into an uncertain future."
" And it's called, ho."
" Now, sometimes we think of hope it's just wishful thinking I say, nah, I hope I'll have hope that I'll come into lot of money so that I can retire. That's a certain level of Hope. But but how from the Christian point of view, Hope from what we articulate from the Bible. It knows that even when bad things happen,"
 God will be there with us and with God's help. We'll be able to cope cope with whatever it is. That is causing us. You and me causing us to be anxious.
" Jesus said in Our Gospel reading today, I am the Good Shepherd. Remember those words today? I am the Good Shepherd, these words point to the god of the Old Testament. That makes himself known to Moses as I am who I am."
" Jesus refers to himself as the Shepherd in the same way that David refers to God is his Shepherd in the 23rd song, where he States, what the Lord is my shepherd. How many of us have put it to memory? The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. And the real part there even though I walk through the darkest of valleys and oftentimes it's rated funerals is the valley did the shadow of death but it's really the Valley of the Shadow, the darkest Valley."
 That he will be our God he will protect us that's the thrust of the 23rd. Psalm in our hope our hope rests in the almighty and all-powerful God who took the tragedy of the Cross and turned it into a victory.
" He overcame sin and death. He rose from the dead and today is a living. Lord, who is our divine? Good Shepherd?"
" Help says that you and I have nothing to be afraid of. Absolutely nothing to be afraid of. Nothing can cut us off from the Everlasting, Love of our savior."
" In the arms of Good Shepherd. You and I we are safe and secure, we can relax."
" We can relax because whatever happens, even if death itself should come, there is nothing. Nothing to be afraid of because the Good Shepherd wants only good for us and we'll take us. You. And me will take us with him to the joy of everlasting life."
" The Bible's picture of a Shepherd. It's nothing like the Sheep Farmers have today kind of how we do, you know, today vast flocks of sheep or across various paddocks and usually well, away from the care of their owners. Oh, they might see the farmer entering in The Paddock Wednesday and certain times of the year, they come with father and that in the seasons when there's plenty of grass,"
" In today's, you know, the Shepherd that the Sheep were just left to fend for themselves. Go out there and eat as much as you want. The grass is full of star there and do it. Oh, they come into the contact with the farmer when it's time for dipping or cartoon or shearing and they're treated with about as much individually individuality the truth about as much individuality is it can of baked beans and the supermarket"
" The old world Shepherds. I was different stories, they lived with and for their see."
" The Palestinian Shepherd who wandered, the hills in search of fresh, pasture for his sheep. Only had a very small flock of sheep and new, each sheep individually."
" And in some places around the world. Shepherd, still watch over there. She leaving them to Grass and whatever. They know the sheep and the Sheep know their master and they happily follow along behind them."
" The shepherd god of the Bible is not some distant, figure uninvolved in our daily lives. Sharing both the good and the bad weather with us."
" One of the most meaningful pictures in Christian art, it shows Jesus the Good Shepherd leaning over Clift with his arms. His arms, reaching down to clutch, and rescue a lamb, which is called in a thorn-bush. The artist. The artist wants to get across the idea that Jesus is the one who cares? The one, who saves the Lost who rescues from trouble."
 He is the only one who is intimately and individually concerned with each one of us.
 He knows each of us by name and knows exactly what his filling us with anxiety at this very moment.
" The image of the rescuing Shepherd leads us to think of what would have happened to that land at the shepherd, hadn't cared enough to rescue it or, or if the shape was wild and stubborn and refused to be helped,"
" Because of his love for his sheep, that the shepherd goes to any lengths to make sure that the Sheep are say."
" Even those times when you, and I feel that life is out of control, think things are happening. That makes this ancient anxious and Afraid of the future. Jesus, the Good Shepherd,"
 suffers with us and suffers for us.
" And even when our worst fears become reality, his presence assures us, that nothing nothing will happen to us. That is outside of his control."
" There's always, there's always a purpose and he will help us through it, and bring Victory out of two seeds. Oh, that's why people like Corrie Ten, Boom, Maximilian Kolbe, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, individuals, who suffer terribly in the hands of the Nazis were defeated and humiliated even killed."
" And yet, they were able to rise above the display. Are they rise above the hopelessness, and in the end?"
 They were victorious.
" They didn't dwell on the negatives. They didn't dwell on the hopelessness of their situations know instead they lived in hope if you and I decide to dwell on all the negatives to keep our mind in our soul simmering, with all the gloominess possibilities, beware that are small, anxieties will grow into big anxieties and they will affect our health."
" They will affect our well-being, they will affect our relationships, and our confidence."
" On the other hand if you and I if we choose if we choose to dwell and hope focus on the Promises of God in the scriptures, we rely on God's love for us and Trust, to get Shepherd, who reaches out to us, to hold us and rescue us, and comfort us, instead of shattering and cringing with anxiety over how things will turn out, always thinking of the Grimace possibilities."
 Picture Jesus right here with us. In the middle of what is causing us so much anxiety.
" That is what the 23rd psalm does. The Lord is my shepherd, David says and I have no reason no reason to be afraid. His rod and his staff they comfort me they protect me his goodness and his mercy and his love will always be with me till the day. I leave this life and enter into eternity."
" We can be even more certain of this than the songwriter was, because we know we, as Christians know of the love and the grace of our Savior, Jesus Christ, you can stake your life on the faithfulness of our loving Shepherd."
" Nothing in the future is stronger than his love for us, no matter, no matter that at the first may seem overwhelming, no Calamity. That engulfs us no grief, which is in his first Dreadful impact. Make us wonder if we will ever ever smile again for indeed."
 The Lord is my shepherd. I have everything I need.
" And in that we say, thanks be to God."
" Beautiful follow-up message in this him, which probably a lot of you have heard. It's a beautiful Hymn for reflection and meditation and the word say take my life and let it be consecrated Lord to thee."
" He's saying there's an opportunity of witness for a world that's quite anxious and all that life is giving. This is an opportunity for us as Christians individually and collectively to shine confidence that those Christian faith gives us. And so together, we share their confidences will go out living in this world this week and we say the Prayer of Saint Francis which truly encourages to make a difference in this world. So let's say this together is, will leave this place. Lord make me an instrument of your peace."
" Where there is hatred, let me sow love where there is injury, pardon, where there is doubt Faith where there is despair, hope where there is Darkness light and where there is sadness Joy. Oh Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console to be understood as to understand to be loved as to love for. It is in giving that we receive it is in pardoning that we are pardoned."

 Lake County Youth Alliance and in support of Lake Oconee youth Alliance. So this is a special first time scholarship. So thank you very much.
" Thank you, appreciate it. Our lectionary reading today comes from 1st jhana. This is not the Gospel of John. This is what's known as first second and third John over there, new revelation, oftentimes text that get neglected. Most of us don't memorize those coming scriptures coming from those tags but what's interesting is this particular passage when I read it to you you're going to recognize quite a few phrases that come from this particular tag. So we oftentimes will quote a but we"
" Oftentimes don't know where it was located when it comes to the scriptures. Because again, this section of the New Testament toward Revelation tends, to get neglected quite often, but this talks about God and love. This is really part of the heavy text whenever we buy, somebody says God is love, you know, it's coming from this text. This is where in the New Testament, the writer of First, John just really expresses the Dynamics of Love who put love means in our"
" Students in our universe. So first John chapter 4, 7 to 21, I'm reading from the common English Bible. Dear Franz, let's love each other because love is from God. And everyone who loves is born from God and knows. God the person who doesn't love, does not know God because God is love. This is how the love of God is revealed to us. God has sent his only son."
" The worlds that we can live through him. This is love. It is not that we loved God, but that God loved us. And sent his son as a sacrifice that deals with our sins. Dear friends. If God loves us this way, we also ought to love each other. No one has ever seen. God, if we love each other, God remains the nose and his love is made. Perfect. In us. This is how we know we were"
 Main in him and he remains and us because he has given us a measure of his spirit.
" We have seen the testified that the father has sent the son to be the savior of the world. If any of us confess that Jesus is God's son, God remains in us and we remain in God, we have known and have believed the love that God has for us."
" God is love and those who remain in love, remaining God, and God remains in them. This is how love has been perfected in us so that we can have confidence on the judgement day because we are exactly the same as God is this in the world. There is no fear in love."
" But perfect, love drives out fear."
" Because fear expects punishments, the person who is afraid has not been made perfect. In love, we love because God, first loved us, those who say, I love, God and hate their brothers and sisters are liars."
" After all those who don't love their brothers and sisters whom they have seen, can hardly love God, whom they have not seen this commandment, we have for him, those who claims to love, God ought to love their brother and sister. Also, this is word of God for the people of God, and we say, thanks be to God as we in our time of prayer, meditation will take him on mother silence, given each of us a chance to lay the concerns of our hearts."
" For God and to your God, still Small Voice breaking directive to each one of us, then I'll lead us to the community prayer and we'll close with the Lord's Prayer. So let us down."
" We've got the once again of God in this place to come and to worship you and during this Easter season. Oh goddess we remain in the power of the resurrection and as we continue to articulate and profess that Christ is risen, he is risen indeed and during this this time of the spring what we seem to live coming out all around us, the blooming of flowers, the the spread of pollen and all the"
" They mix of life that are around us. Lord we reminded of the new birth. He comes from east of the Resurrection. So what an appropriate season for the church to be celebrating and remembering what you've done for us. Lord, and the world that we see all the Dynamics that are happening around us."
" We pray for strength to comes from you. Then we stay rooted rooted on the Solid Ground of which we stand amongst all the shifting sand of the world around whenever chaotic Dynamics. Peggy happening, personally in our lives and then collectively as a community, and nation and world."
 I was floored to see the concerns that are around us and to show us give us Direction on how we should address those concerns.
 Help us not to be apathetic and unconcerned about those who are less fortunate around us.
 I was to continue to see opportunities opportunities for service for transformation for making a difference that our lives will truly make a difference because we're leaving for you.
" Today. Oh God is we see this text from first, John and realize how much love is evident. It is what you are all about. It is what we are all about, learning to love one another and learning to love you really is the greatest of The Commandments."
 Help us Lord to reach that challenge to meet it to embody it.
" To truly be different Lord. For if we love you and love others, we do know you."
" And we do live in you, we ask that you bless all of these things, the name of Jesus, the one who told us to pray, Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us. Our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil. For thine is the kingdom"
" And the power and the glory forever and ever. Some children were asked what they thought that love is. And here's their answer. Love is like this, when my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over to put her shoes on anymore. So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis, too."
" Lagos. My mother goes with my dad in his boat even though she knows she will get seasick. Love is when your puppy licks your face and you don't care, even though he has been eating something that really failed. Love is my dad getting up in the middle of the night to change my sheets after I've thrown up on every way. Or God could have said magic words to make the nails fall off the cross. But he"
 Because he loves us.
 Isn't it interesting to know? The children didn't talk about some sort of warm fuzzy feeling about toward one person to one person's toward another but rather what they focused on was what love does.
" Because of that, they are very helpful and very meaningful meanings. When we talk about, what is it? That love does in our life. Like this example, my dad got really angry with my mother but she ran in when she ran into the garage door with the car and love is seeing them hug and make up."
" Love is the word that describes the relationship between two people, but it's more than that."
 Love involves action. Love involves words that demonstrate that one person is special.
" Oh mother state next weekend. You know the words I love you Mom or important because they're Hollow but they if they are Hollow if those words are not followed up with any kind of actions which are motivated by the love that has just been expressed, just give it a card, it's not enough."
" When the Apostle Paul talks about love and his famous words is the rampions. He doesn't describe a feeling the warm feeling. This been close to a person, is the feeling that it gives us when we're close to person. There's no way he's talking about instead. Paul gets to the heart of what love is by describing the love. What love does and what love does not do. Oh, you know, the text is right at lots of wedding."
" His love is patient and kind love is not jealous or boastful or rude or proud. Love does not demand its own way. Love is not irritable and it keeps no record of when it has been wronged love indoors, through all circumstances and therefore gives us"
" We know these words Often by hearted and the kind of roll off the tongue so easily, but they can be quite difficult to put actually into practice."
" When a person is really agitating, when a person is selfish, when a person is inconsiderate, Paul says that love dictates that we are to be patient, kind, never rude or irritable and that we should leave no stone unturned to be friends again with that person."
" In this kind of situation, regardless of the injury calls to us, love demands, certain action on our part."
" When we're trying to deal with a breakdown in a relationship with another person, this is not the time that feelings are to take control because it's likely that the feelings will only want to get back at the other person is likely that the feelings want to justify. Justify our own wrong and accused and condemned the other person and get us all uptight."
 To say things say things that are actually quite unkind Instead. This is the time this is the time for the kind of love that only wants peace and harmony.
 The kind of love that is willing to forgive past hurts and to reach out and friendship.
 To those who hold that? What goes around comes around this kind of love that. Paul is talking about. It is quite a logical.
" Oh, and it demonstrates the kind of weakness in a person's character."
" What the Bible says is so different, so different than that worldly thinking."
 Strength of character is shown when a person determines to only let love love control their words and actions. This is the kind of love that John warranted and was referring to here in 1st John when he talked about the undeserved love that God has shown to us John first on for 10. Then I read this is what love is. It is not that we have loved God.
" Have to take God, loved us and sent his son to be. The means by which our sins are forgiven."
" The Bible is quite clear, there is no doubt about God's patience with us. God's love will always follow us no matter how how terrible you and I have been or how much we have ignored his love for us. God's love is always supportive. God's love is always encouraging especially when things are going wrong."
" His love involves sacrifice giving up the life of Jesus on the cross, just for us."
 His love for involves that sacrifice. Just to forgive us and to make it possible for us to be friends with him again.
 His love gives us hope.
 That when our journey is finished.
 When we're finished here on this planet.
 We have eternal life in heaven.
" His love is a never-ending Supply forgiveness, for all all, who trust and believe that Jesus died for them."
" On Saturday, September 18th 1982, the US government released the results of the very sad investigation. It reported that a soldier stationed in Korea had defected to the Communists. And according to the investigation on August 28th 1982, this 20 year old private willingly cross the Korean demilitarized zone into North Korea"
" Motives that are not known his fellow American soldiers, pleaded with him to turn back but this Soldier did not respond. Well, the day after the findings were released the parents of the young man held a press conference on the lawn of their home and wiping tears from their eyes. You can just imagine wiping tears from the eyes of father said that they accepted the fact that indeed there son."
" Was The Defector he has lost his credibility in this country. Even with me said the man, but then he showed the heart of the flaws arm. I still love my son, he said and I want him back."
" That is the kind of loving heart that our heavenly father has for us. In fact, I don't believe we can even grasp what God is really high."
 The holy Lord of Heaven and Earth or creator of the universe. Our creator loves us so powerfully that he will stop at nothing. He will stop at. Absolutely nothing to restore us with the relationship into a relationship with him.
 His love is such that he would even let Jesus Christ. God himself be subject to the sinfulness of the humanity and to down across for us.
 The god that God should do. All that is all of this for us for you and me just speaks of the of the vastness of the universe. It's absolutely amazing when you think about it.
" This just where we're a speck in the universe the way. There's not much to us, it all he's got to do is see the latest astronomy and realized that the Earth is not in the center of the universe by any means for on the backside to some degree of a lot of other activity going on. And yet, God loves us as little specks over here in the universe."
" I need to know you and I we hurt our heavenly father with every sin that we commit, he still, he still says to us. I love you. I love you. And I want you to come by."
 Jesus died for all the times that you and I we have failed that love. He died to give us a fresh start. Taking all of our sin on himself and making us his special people. God wants us to be the kind of people. He created us to be people who will go to any lengths to show love toward others in the same way that Jesus gave up everything for us.
" Six year old Brandon decided, one Saturday morning to make pancakes for his parents."
" He found a big bowl and a spoon. You can just imagine this pulled up a chair, to the kitchen bench, open the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour. Canister, spilling it all on the floor, he scooped up some of the flour into the bowl with his hands and he mixed it in with a cup of milk and added some sugar and an egg leaving, a kind of Flowery Trail on the floor."
" Brandon was covered in flour and getting frustrated, he wanted. He wanted this to be something very good for his mother and father, but it was going very bad."
" As he got down off the chair, he knocked the egg carton onto the floor frantically. He tried to clean out this Monumental mess, but but slipped on the eggs and landed on the floor, getting his pajamas, all sticky and and just covered with flour. Just use your imagination of what's going on in the kitchen and just the end. Just then he saw his dad standing at the door."
" With big tears, welded and Brandon's eyes, all he wanted to do was to do something good."
 But he had made the terrible Mass.
" He was sure he was going to get into deep trouble, but his father, just watched and and walk you through the mess, he picked up his crying son and hugged him, giving his own pajamas, white with flour and sticky with broken eggs in the process of loving him. And then he proceeded to help Brandon make the best batch of Pancakes."
 Only love only love you know only love can make that mess cleaned up for you. See our love might be far from perfect and in spite of our good intentions we end up in a mess.
" But that doesn't lessen. God's love for us in any way. God loved rolls up his sleeves and gets all messy, and he got all Misty dying on the cross for us."
" He hugs us, he loves us. He forgives us. He encourages us and he helps us through the Holy Spirit. Put on love everyday."
 John goes home his letter and says dear friends. If this is how God loves us then we should love it. One another and a bit later. He says the command that Christ has given us is this who 11. Whoever loves God must love others. Also
 What could be clearer than that?
" Receiving God's love places on us, the responsibility to share that same love. There is a call to obedience here, a call to following God's way a call to live life as people who've been saved, called redeemed and sent out,"
 There's nothing to suggest that showing love is optional.
" There is nothing here to suggest that love is the kind of thing you can do when his suit you or when you feel close to a person or when another person is kind to you. When John says, whoever loves God must love others. Also, there are no ifs, buts or maybes, no room for asking first. Well, what is the person died?"
 For me.
 To put it more bluntly. This isn't feeling good kind of love.
 The kind of love that appeals to our emotions and to our feelings.
" The kind of love that Jesus is talking about, it's a very practical kind of love."
" A sacrificial kind of love. The kind of love that doesn't ask. What the cost is, is a lot of that doesn't rely on friendly feelings toward others. That's the kind of love that Jesus has for us. There was nothing likable or friendly about those who now, Jesus, to the cross. And yet, Jesus could steal still look at them with nothing."
 But love and forgiveness.
 We know all too well that this kind of love is just so hard. We mess up daily in our attempts to be kind and caring and compassionate and understanding. We feel bad that that our love has been selectively showing love only to those who have been kind to us
 We feel bad because they're been limits on just how much we do for. We will do for someone else.
" We feel bad that love, it's not being the controlling force that guides us in our relationships. And the restoring of those relationships, when things go south, what makes us feel even worse? What makes this feel even worse? Is when we hear Jesus. Say, love one another."
 As I love you.
" If that's your experience, that's the precise reason that Jesus died on the cross."
" And our baptism. And every time we come for the Lord's supper and everything else, he reminds us that even though we have failed, we are still steal. His dearly love to run."
" Even though we find it so hard to love, as he has commanded, he doesn't give up on us."
" When the love of Jesus is in a hard, We Go From Here. Determined that his love. Will truly make a difference."
 We've been told God is love.
 And we need to love others.
" And for that, we say, thanks be to God."
" I used to play the piano and another church. And the woman that put in there was an organist in the woman that played the organ, was very strict on the Methodist lectionary. When terms of the hymns and we weren't able to play. For example, if we couldn't play A Christmas, Carol, during Advent and she also wouldn't wouldn't let us sing songs about the cross until after Easter. I don't know if she was right or wrong, but it is beautiful to hear all the great."
 Seems about the cross in the sun days after Easter.
" If you'll, please stand and have several folks, to be traveling this coming weekend for Mother's Day. So, safe travels of you all have wonderful. Wonderful, Mother's Day for next weekend for those from being able to be with family and for the rest of us will see you here next. Sunday are close to benediction is the prayer of Saint Francis. Encouraging each of us to be instruments of God's peace. Let's say this together as we leave this place. Lord, make me an instrument of your peace, where there is hatred. Let me sow."
" Where there's injury pardon where there is doubt Faith, where there is despair, hope where there is Darkness light and where there is sadness Joy. Oh Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console to be understood as to understand to be loved as to love for. It is in giving that we receive it is in pardoning that we are pardoned as they die. They were"
 Born to eternal life. I'm here have a great week. Thank you for being here was great. Having you all working with us here on the internet. Like you can join us in person and give us the address to come here.
Yo.
" Good morning. This is indeed a that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in. It is good to see you all here today for the Second Sunday of Easter which begins to seize. The most people think he stirs only one day, but actually he stirs a full season that we go until Pentecost. And so we invite me here, glad to have you all here for the beginning of that season. I did want to reference in case you want to. Wait. We weren't aware Carolyn fears. We've had it hurt our prayer list. She said it."
" With the brain tumor issue. So Carolyn has been a very active person with other Purpose with the country players, other kind of activities here in the lake area. So skip Flint said that to me this yesterday or day before and anyway we want you to we've added Carolyn to our list. These keep her in our prayers as well. Glad to have it come up and share with us this morning Dynamics concerning the like the kind of Youth Alliance said."
 Good morning. I've been asked to share with you. A little update on the Lake Oconee youth Alliance.
" And they gave me three five minutes. So the only way I had know how to do that is to kind of put it in a journalism form of writing an article. And if I were going to write this article, I would I would use the headlines of loc. See scholarships change lives."
 I would put the lead in there.
 Up to day 21 students from Putnam.
 And green counties.
" Representing are attending eight different universities throughout the state of Georgia are currently attending these universities and may not have had that chance, had it not been for this congregation and Lake Oconee Community Church."
 Now these students the second paragraph would go on to say that these students.
 Are majoring in things like computer science.
" Fashion psychology, anthropology business education, and on, and on and on and the impressive thing."
 Is that these 21 students currently carry a GPA Collective GPA of 3.6.
 Something some of us. Never additionally. There are eight students. There are eight students that made the President's List and that is a perfect 4.0
" And as you read down through the article, you would see a brief history."
" about all that how all this came about, going back to roughly 2010 when our Focus back then was"
" And and you can correct me on a lot of this, what our Focus back then was on summer enrichment, programs, we had field trips for the kids that went to Fernbank World, cope the capitol, Martin Luther, King memorials, and on, and on, and on."
 And then somewhere around.
 2017.
 We refocused.
" we knew that we were handling, or our"
 What's the word we were?
" Giving service to kids in the elementary Primary Elementary, Middle Schools and high schools with our various programs of the imagineers of Buddy. Programs of lunch with buddies programs, etc, etc. But we didn't have closure"
 On some of the kids as they went off to college.
 And that's where we began to refocus on providing scholarships and I believe it was 2018.
 Was when our first scholarships were awarded.
 And what started in 2018 is now up to 21 kits.
" Now, we began all of this with this congregation and your contributions."
 That is undeniable.
 It is a program that has kind of grown because of the need has grown outside of the confines of this church and into the community.
" That is the reason right around 2020. Last year, we formed the Lake Oconee youth Alliance. It is simply to provide the opportunity for us to engage other churches, other businesses, other individuals in are in the assistance program for college students, because although every year"
" We have some well this year alone, I think Rita, we have what 20 applications are, no 12 applications already, not all those kids will receive scholarships and particularly in the current environment would covid. It's going to be even less than that."
" But what we're trying to continue to do, is to raise money for these kids are long range gold and it's an ambitious one for the lake of County Youth Alliance."
 Is to establish enough principle.
 Close to a million or two million dollars were weakened every year guarantee.
" without asking this church or anybody else for additional funds, we can guarantee them"
 Money's for scholarships.
 the Lego County Youth Alliance which this church is the Cornerstone in the founding member
 has no paid professional staff has donated office space. It is actually the second floor of the pyramid building. We just get a sign up there so we have no overhead to speak of 99 percent of every dollar you spend.
 Goes directly towards the scholarship program.
" We would ask that this year and I know it's a tough year that you give generously when you make your check out. The only thing you have to do is when you put loc, see put the word scholarships beside it."
 And the more support this church continues to give it shows our displays an example of continued support that we can share with other churches and businesses. Thank you.
" oh, by the way, for those of you that missed the behind the Gates article,"
" In last month's edition, of inside the gates, I'm sorry on page 66. This article appeared, I have half a dozen or 12 dozen 12 copies with me and I'll leave them on the back table. It explains the entire program in much better detail, I just did thank you."
" I felt a reference today, Coker is the board chair for youth Alliance or proud of him being there. Also, Linda Robinson, who's here, this morning represents us on that board. And then of course we just gags is amazing mover and Shaker on my view when I'm solving here this morning. So it's good to have them president. Have them represented only youth Alliance. Thank you. A good job. There are several appearance stories that occur about Jesus in the New Testament and the gospels. His"
" Students tacos post. Resurrection, of course. The famous one is ready to Emmaus which we've done on other years this year the lectionary maze to John and the appearance story that's quite famous. This recorded in the Gospel of John. Chapter 20 verses 19 through 31, I'll be reading from the common English Bible. It was still the first day of the week that evening when the disciples were behind closed doors because they were afraid of the Jewish authorities."
" Jesus came and stood among them. And he said, peace be with you. After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. And when the disciples saw the Lord, they were filled with joy. Jesus said to them again, peace be with you as the father sent me. So I am sending you then he breathed on them and said, receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven. If you don't forgive them, they are not forgiven Thomas."
" That's when they called Artemis. One of the twelve was not with the disciples when Jesus came. The other disciples told him, we have seen the Lord, but he replied unless I see the nail marks in his hands, but my finger in the wounds left, by the nails and put my hand into his side. I won't believe."
" After eight days, the disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with him even though the doors were locked Jesus entered and stood among them. He said peace be with you. Then he said to Thomas, put your finger here. Look at my hands, put your hand into my side. No more disbelieve, believe Thomas responded to Jesus. My Lord. And my God, Jesus replied. You believe because you see me? Blessed are those"
 Don't see. And yet believe.
" And Jesus did many other Miracles miraculous science in his disciples presence signs, that aren't recorded in this scroll, that these things are written, so that you will believe that Jesus is the Christ God's son and that believe in, you will have life in his name. This is the word of God for the people of God, and we say, thanks be to God as we in our time of prayer, meditation, right? Each of us to take moment of silence given us, a chance to hear the voice of God. Speaking directly to each one of us."
" For us to be able to share within our own Hearts, the concerns that we have and laid them before God. Then I ladies that you came to me to prayer will close with the Lord's Prayer. So, let us bow."
" We Gather once again. Oh God into this place to come and worship you and in this Easter season. Oh God. We live within the power of the resurrection. And hopefully all year is the Easter season. But least until now the Pentecost the church Universal acknowledges that this is the season that we live. This kind of understanding of Good Friday and Easter Sunday. And even though things may not be perfect in the circumstances,"
" around us, there is still some power that comes from the resurrection, and for Jesus being present with us,"
" So Lord help our lives reflect that with everybody would come in contact with we as a church may we be your presence here in Lake Oconee and Beyond giving that life-giving presence collectively and individually and it truly making a difference, making an indifference in a world that desperately needs us."
 So help us to be disciplined. Oh Lord. Forgive us when we're a pathetic.
" And we just pray, Lord, that we will be faithful and all that you called us to be. We pray all this in the name of Jesus. There's the resurrected one, the one who told us to pray, Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us. Our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver"
 brought us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever is there something that you are afraid of
 What is it that he either paralyzes you with fear or it starts you screaming.
" I mean, maybe it's one of these mice to phobia, the fear of dirt Hydrophobia, the fear of water"
" Not to phobia, the fear of darkness."
" A rat acrophobia, the fear of high places Arachnophobia, the fear of spiders xenophobia, the fear of strangers higher authority, Bia. The fear of priests, or pastors claustrophobia, the fear of confined places."
" These next one's gonna be a little tough. Try try cock Trice, Kosta coffee. Oh, it's his me. Try skog be cut Tuffy. Oh, the fear of the number 13,"
 Thank you and happy and I'm going to have you do this last one and then give me a minute Titta phobia or German phobia the fear of Germans but this is a this is a daisy. Maybe you'll know this a hand. Okay. Hypo poto monstrous equip it DOD filho it is the fear of long words. So you know the anything there's a story about the Anglican Archbishop
" Of Dublin who had badly, damaged his back in the fall. And from that moment, from that moment, the Archbishop he constantly lived in fear of being paralyzed. And so he was constantly feeling his legs. He was constantly pinching his legs to see if he had had paralysis. Well, lady was sitting next to him at a dinner and she noticed that the Agent Bishop was agitated"
" Any any kept kind of muttering to himself and so he and he's just sitting there going. Well, it's come at last, it's coming less. I can't feel a thing. I can't believe. I finally happen. I'm paralyzed. What kind like the woman asked the muttering Bishop what's wrong? And he said, well, I've been pitching my legs for the last five minutes and I can't feel a thing. He replied. I must be paralyzed and the woman answered."
" Sure this. All right Your Grace. It's my leg. You've been pinching for the person who has some kind of phobia. There is no peace. There is no peace. Until the object causing the figure is removed. Oh, got a good friend who has a phobia of stuffed toys to, can you imagine teddy bear stuffed toys. She can't bear a fluffy toy for whatever reason, anywhere near her. And she"
" I will not relax will not relax, until the toy is removed. Likewise another person who has signed a phobia, she is terrified, if there's a dog, anywhere, nearby, fear can be illogical, in fear can be, baseless after all, what harm can a fluffy toy actually calls?"
" But for the person affected by such fear, it is real and they cannot relax."
" The disciples were afraid though. They were confused. They had witnessed the Called Death of Jesus on the cross Peter, and John had witnessed the empty tomb early that morning, but we're told that they did. We are told that they did not understand anything. Jesus is said about rising from the dead after three days. They had listened to Mary magdalene's account of her meeting with Jesus in The Garden near the tomb where Jesus had been laid. They gather together on the evening of Easter Day behind."
 Locked doors.
 They were afraid and they had reason reason to be afraid. The temple authorities have been out to get Jesus for mines. Oh repeatedly they were seeking ways to get rid of this Troublemaker. Try to trap him and making statements that they could use against him. And the disciples also knew from their experience that the chief priests in the church.
" Priests and other religious authorities, they were determined determined. And in the end God what they wanted, the death of a man who they believed undermines has the authority and challenge the religious beliefs of the people. Since the authorities have been instrumental in the torture and death of their Master, it was no wonder. No wonder that they were huddled together."
 Behind locked doors.
" Who knows that there might be the next one's that they were the next one's to be dragged away and treated like Jesus for after all the rumor, the rumor had been spread that Jesus body had been taken from the tomb and it was highly likely that the authorities would blame the disciples."
" But it was not only the religious authorities the disciples fee or one of their own, it actually portrayed betrayed. Jesus Judas was more than just a friend Judas had been one of the core group of disciples that was chosen by Jesus. It is, is it possible that someone else and they knew personally could also be traded down?"
 Whom could they Trust?
" Their Fear wasn't some unreasonable in logical phobia it was real. And their fear was so intense that they forgot the many words of assurance and comfort that Jesus had spoken to them. Jesus had warned and he wore them that he would be going away, but told them not to worry."
" Not to be upset but to trust in God. But at the moment, all that you feel is fear"
" So when they met, they make sure that the doors were locked and I dare say, make sure that very few people knew where they were meeting."
" Fear fear can be a confusing condition. Oh, there's good fear and there's bad fear. If you're trying to cross the busy street in his good to be afraid, I wish more people along the Atlanta Highway in Athens where a little more afraid as they're walking around jaywalking all over Atlanta Highway. But if you're trying to cross these be be afraid. You know, if you notice frayed wires on your electric appliances, it's right to be"
" Grade, if you're caught in a storm, it's normal to fear the lightning and destructive forces that the way end. But if fear is give it to larger role, if fear begins to dominate your thoughts, feelings and behavior, it can become distracting."
 It can become distorting.
 It can become disabling. It can even become a dangerous emotion.
 It fear causes you to panic in the middle of a tricky. Driving maneuver or make sure mind go blank in the middle of an exam or prevent you from talking to a certain person for no longer week for no logical reason than fear controls you.
 and give it too much rain you and I no longer or able to think and to do things normally
" and when the Risen Lord appears to the disciples behind locked doors, this only adds to their fears,"
" Jesus Is Dead. They had seen it with their own eyes. They panicked. And the first thing, Jesus, addresses in their fear, we are told that Jesus came and stood among them peace, be with you. He said, then to make it doubly, sure that they got the message. She said to them, again, peace be with you."
" This man in front of them, showed him the Deep wounds in his hands and a gash in his side. And Jesus message in spite of all of that, is, that is threatening all that is changing. All that defies human understanding is simply peace, be with you relax. Don't be afraid. I am with you."
" When Thomas is confused by the disciples claimed to have seen Jesus alive and declares he can't believe, unless he actually touches the scars of Jesus hands inside, Jesus appears to him, and his message is the same. Even in the face of Doubt, Jesus says simply peace be with you."
" And then he gives Thomas what he needs to believe Martin Luther the great reformer preacher from this same text noted this I quote just as Christ did not stay long outside away from his frightened disciples but soon was there comforting them and saying, peace be unto you. I am calm be of good cheer and fear not."
 So it is still when you and I are afraid. God lifts us odd.
" This is how the Easter message works when God, what a cock, but God accomplished in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, it changes everything. The Risen Savior brings us. Peace."
" When you and I are downhearted about our sin. When you and I are upset about the way we have treated others. And especially God, the Risen Christ, brings us, forgiveness, and peace."
" When our sins are forgiven and our relationships are restored, this brings peace to a guilty conscience."
" It brings healing and Reconciliation between those hurt and offended. It brings newness and a fresh start. We have peace of mind because we no longer have to fear the Judgment of God on all that. We do say. And think that is. So contrary to what God wants of us, we say it in our liturgy again and again, after we have heard that we are forgiven peace, be with you as part"
" Whitney is part of language that we use in church as well. The Risen Jesus brings peace because we fear the day of our death or when we stand in the open grave of a loved one it is natural. It is normal for us to have the kind of fear fear but overriding this fear is the sure sure, knowledge, sure, knowledge. That when we pass through the dark Valley of Death you and I"
" Will enter a glorious New Life in eternity. The Risen Christ gives peace. When you and I face times of Doubt, confusion crisis sickness and grieve."
" The fact that we have a savior who is risen from the dead assures us, that he is present with us in those times, as king of kings and Lord of lords. He is able to support and help us."
" Oh, there's a lot in life that can make you an IRA freid threats to our personal safety threats to Career paths threats to happiness of our families threats to our financial security and threats to our health. We may be frightened by sickness or by aging."
" There are so many things that can cause you, and I to be panicky and Afraid."
" And in every case and in every moment, Our Savior appears to us as one who offers us, peace."
" He is the one who comes through the locked doors and lovingly assures. The terrified peace be with you. Jesus offers each of us, security, love and peace in the scariest toughest most confusing times of Our Lives. He is the ever-present Living Lord and his commitment to us. Never ever waivers."
" Now, we come to an interesting challenging part of the text, the peace that Jesus gives isn't just for our private use. He goes on to say is the father sent me?"
" So I send you to put it, simply the piece of the Risen Savior, the piece that the Savior gives is to be shared. It is to be passed on to those who are around us who live in fear. After experiencing God's peace, what we hear from God, through his word, we are challenged to share the piece that we have experienced with those who have no peace."
" There are those who are burdened with, in our community, within our relationships. There are those who are burdened with guilt. There are those who are afraid of surgery. There are those who are afraid of old age, and dying. There are those who need the peace of God in their lives. Jesus commission's. Each of us, each of us to be challenges of his channels if he is peace to others,"
" Pass on the piece that you've received for me. Jesus tells his 21st century disciples pass on the piece and know that this will make a difference in the lives of individuals, a difference in the life of the church and of the community as a whole"
 Locked doors could not keep him out.
 Nothing. Can
" He is present among us today, as surely as fully as he was with the disciples in the locked room, on that first Easter. He is here with us to free us from our fears. He is here with us to speak his piece to our hearts into our hearts. He is here to forgive our sins. He is here to turn our sorrow into gladness. He is here to bless us and to challenge us to pass."
" On his peace, his peace be with you also."
 So the Peace of Lord made the peace be with you.
 Thanks be to God.
" Most beautiful hymns about pieces, probably, It Is Well with My Soul and maybe you've heard the story of the him in. 1873 a prominent, Chicago attorney, and businessman.

" Break down every wall was the Tiny's for. You cannot survive in me. Break. Gotta break through some aside for every little girl creation crime. God, we praise you."
" Maybe the song that comes a storm inside me Letty, right?"
 This is what living looks like. See you in the shirt. This is what living looks like. This is what freedom feels like this.
 This world him in sounds like we praise you. We praise you. This is what living looks like. This is what freedom feels like. This is what heaven. Sounds like we praise you. We praise you. This is what it looks like.
" Creation, kind of God."
" With just one word, you come storm that surrounds me with just one word, the darkness has to retreat."
 We just wanted to touch. I feel present to heaven.
" We just want to turn II's are open to see my heart. Can help me. There's nothing that I've got can't do this. Not a mountain that he can move praising. A, that makes away. This nothing never got into just won't work."
 You kill. It's broken inside.
" Just watch and you five every dream. We just wanted, I feel nothing."
" This is not a mountain that crazy, it's nothing."
" I will believe for greater things, the scene at church I will believe for greater things. This will power like the power of Jesus. They faint arise Little Hook, read this one power like the power of Jesus. I will believe who Creator. Things isn't power? Like a power of two."
" If a the rise, they'd all the grief, there's a power like the power of Jesus. Let me there's nothing that I can."
 This not a mountain that I praise her.
" Maybe let's give the Lord a hand, this morning church, if you will have a seat as we enter into the time of community."
" And there's all the being seated. If you still need to get a cup, we've got two different cups with the bread and the juice. We got some of both tables. Feel free to go ahead and do that right now. That is not a problem, you know, if we were to do a quick non-scientific survey around the room right now. And I said, if I were to ask each and every one of you, do you believe that there's nothing that God can't do."
" I am inclined to believe that at least 99.9 percent of us would without a doubt, not even think about it. So yes, there's nothing that our God can't do."
" I think that I think that's where most of us are however, and also, if we were to sit around, if you go back to the night of the Lord's, Supper when the disciples are sitting around the table with Jesus, at least 11 of the 12 that were sitting there would have said the same thing. There's nothing that God can't do. They've seen him do Miracles. We've seen him. Do Miracles. We read about it in the Bible."
" but the disconnect happens when our faith goes into action because we see that the disciples, even though they were there, even though they were used by Jesus in performing some of the Miracles when it came down to it,"
" They doubted, they ran. They were scared. They were fearful and it's the same way in our own life when it comes to God, telling us to do something too many times. We allow the fear to overcome our faith."
" But what we have to be able to do is to put that belief that we all hold dearly, that there's nothing that God can't do and allow that to become real in our life."
" And that's that's difficult. I'm not up here saying that it's easy to do, but yet that's what God wants us to do that night, Jesus and the disciples were met, they met in the upper room, they sat around the table for as what we know the Last Supper an opportunity for Jesus to kind of explain to him what was happening."
" And even then they, they didn't understand. They've heard Jesus teaching their heard all about it but they still this night as they were sitting, there were completely lost about what was about to take place. Some of us are that same way we come to the table today, we don't understand what's going on in our life."
 But you know what? We don't have to all we have to do is trust in Christ and the believe that there's nothing that he can't do and allow that Faith to drive our to drive our decisions.
" Paul writes in First Corinthians 11 is, he's writing to the church at Corinth, he's teaching them about the Lord's Supper. So, there's morning as we take it, we're going to follow the way that Paul writes. It first Corinthians chapter 11 starting at verse 23. He says, for a pass on to you, what I received from the Lord himself on the night, when he was betrayed, the Lord, Jesus took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and said, this is my body which is given for you."
 Do this in remembrance of me.
 Just don't have nothing.
" After they took that says, then, starting in verse 25, in the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper saying, this cup is the New Covenant between God and his people, an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it."
" Now, what we just participated in these elements are nothing more than a little bit of unleavened bread and grape juice."
" But yet what they symbolize exactly, what Jesus taught us that night as they sat around the table with the disciples, his body, which was broken for us, his blood, which was shed for us because of the breaking of those body. And the shedding of his blood that allows us to allow our sins to be forgiven when we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and savior. And it's through our forgiveness, through the Forgiveness of sins that then we are allowed to go."
" Spend eternity with with God in heaven, the greatest gift you and I will ever be given took place when Jesus died on the cross and when the tomb was empty, three days later. So today, allow your faith to be stronger than your fears. Fears are real but yet, but just understand. And don't forget that we worship a God, that there's nothing that he can do. Let's pray, father, we thank you for the opportunities. We have to come."
" I'm together to come to your table to remember, the sacrifice you did for us."
" And father may be something that we remember each and every day of our life of how our lives are different, it can be different because of you dying on the cross for us."
" you went to the cross, a perfect human being"
" And you took upon yourself, our sins."
" So that we don't have to pay the price for them. You already have so father as we go about our lives each and every day. Allow us to never forget this and as we think, and as we believe that there's nothing that you can't do, allow that belief to become action in our life each and every day."
" As a testament to you for what you've done for us is the testimony of others around us so that they too can see how awesome of a God. You are father. Thank you for your love for us. Your love was so great that you sent your son to die on the cross for us. Thank you, Father. We ask it all in Jesus Christ name. Our Lord and our savior. Amen."
" Cheers, let's stand to our feet as we continue to sing today. In Christ tells us, he will never leave us or forsake us. We feel like we're alone. God says he's with us. Seeing these words out with this is"
" This increase when the hardest son to fight another way, when the walls are closing in. When I look at the space between where I used to be and this record knee, I know I will never be alone. It was another in the fire."
" Standing next to me, was another if no water, he's holding back, the scenes. Should I ever need? Remind me how I've been set free. There is across the Bears. The burden we have another time."
 All my dad left for dead beneath Ward.
 I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore. Should I fall in the space between where domain to be and it's reckoned? Be either way. I will bow to things of this world Dino. I will never be another in the fire.
" There is another in the water holding back the Seas. Should I have what power Set Me Free? There is a great need volt. Nobody now that power lives in me, there is another in the fire."
" There is no other name but the name that is Jesus, he who was, and still is and be through it all."
 So come what may in the space between all these things unseen and this record P I know I will never be Dino how I will never be.
 Holding back.
 I know that's where you be. Can a joint? Come everybody. Cause I know that's where you'll be counting joint command.
" A battle cause I know that's where you'll be counting joint, come everybody. Cause I know that's where you be father. This morning we want to thank you now, that you are Willis. How did you promises? She won't leave us. You won't forsake us. I didn't you want. What is best for those who are called according to"
" To your purpose in today. God, I just pray that there was someone here who's looking for something deeper in this life guy that they would know without a doubt that a relationship with you is something deeper than this world has to offer got in today, I just pray that the Holy Spirit would move and then in these walls today in our hearts now to show us what we need to do to draw closer to you. Today, we love you. We thank you. We praise your name today in Jesus name, amen?"
 Maybe.
" Good morning, Lakes on, welcome to church today. It's an honor to be here to speak to you, and I want to thank you for coming my early. Life can be wrapped up or summarized in a verse of scripture. Psalm 122 says"
" I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord, my mother made sure that my two brothers and I would be found in the house of the Lord, whenever the doors were open, we enjoyed that. It was it some sort of for the basis. For my upbringing, the church friends that I had also became a community. So the things that I did on Sunday, I was able to do on Monday through Friday, and still spend time with my Christian friends. God was good. And when I get to heaven, I"
" My mother again, for doing such a wonderful job. Sure. We call some Truffles and I'll have to apologize to her for that because she races in a Christian home. And I joined the church at age 12 because I thought it was symbolic. Since Jesus went to the synagogue at age 12 in order to partially reveal himself as he taught the teachers there in my later years, I ran into some storms in life and I just want to share with you one main one and mentioned the other one."
" It's God was there and God was in charge, and he'll always be there in charge."
" And we should be grateful for them. If I was in charge, I would mess it up. There's a verse in Ephesians 1:11, it says God worked things. According to the counsel of his will to me it means that he's in control and he was in control every step of the way, you're this big storm that I had. I went to a playoff game with school on the evening of November. The 11th 2001, November the 7th 2011 to see a one act play before they went to the state."
" I passed out when the lights were brought down for the plate of start. Just went unconscious and I figured it was something to do with my lungs, but I don't know because I didn't wake up till Thursday afternoon. Shane Hill was there along with a couple nurses and they responded to CPR shocked me. They called the ambulance and continue to do the same thing. They life. Flighted me to making did open, heart surgery in the next morning, and I woke up"
" The afternoon with a fresh heart. God was good. He was in charge of the details. He had the right people there at the right time. He had the doctors there. They could do the surgery and a helicopter that was available and people pray, it will people praying at the auditorium. There were people praying at the hospital, they were people playing at the helipad and to me, I give all the glory to God for their faithfulness and for his control, some other storms that I had, that were minor."
" But became major was my lunch and worse and worse and I had a lung transplant in 2014. I subsequently had prostate cancer, that was cured by radiation. I also had emergency colon resection because I had a burst code and had to have a bag for three months."
" I will say food, add, and remove the bag. Three months later end of last year, I had pulmonary fibrosis. That was Major, who in all of God's in control, please let him be in control of your storms. And if anybody wants to talk to me, I'd be glad to God bless you and thank you. Good morning, makes I make sure he wanted to say good morning twice. Come on now, skip. All right. Look, I don't know if you guys saw that. Look at there was ever a"
" Time for someone to turn and be bitter. Would that not be through that kind of story, right? Like, when you constantly are going, it feels like you're uphill battle. After battle after battle that Skipper, right? And so, if you're new here, let me tell you what we're in, we're in a series called Lakeside stories. You guys are getting to hear stories of our people, as they share where God showed up and how he showed up in their lives. I want you to know this the same Jesus that is in."
" In Skippers story is the same Jesus that wants to move in yours as well. Amen. Hey listen. Today you ever. Yeah, I mean years ago it seemed to be popular. Haven't seen them as much lately. But do you remember the commercials where it had the easy button, right? Like you just want the Easy Button, I love the easy but like, I wish I could live at Easy Button lifestyle. Sometimes I find myself saying this often and then I look at stories, like we're diving into today and"
" My mind kind of shifts, right? And I'll kind of give you a little bit of heads up, it just so you kind of know that sometimes if you heard that song that last song, I'm not sure if you guys were paying attention in those lyrics count, the joy of every battle because I know that's where you'll be in the middle of whatever storm you face today. I want you to hear very clearly. Jesus is there and he's with you"
" There's there's a story in the 80s, there was an experiment done in a biodome, right? They set this glass bubble, basically, out in the desert and they filled it with trees and plants and flowers. And let me just tell you everything seemed to go really well until they discovered that the trees would hit a certain height. And you know what they began to do, they begin to fall right now the the what began to happen in this is the scientist and everybody began to study and what they"
" Bird was this one of the ways that trees grow? Especially their Roots is through wind, wind, write a little friction, allows the roots to dig deeper and deeper. And let me ask you, you know, when you sit back and you think about this, the easy life may not be the most fruitful life. It may not be the most faithful life, right? And I just want to remind you where ever,"
" We are however, you came in today, some of you, you are battling. You are in the middle of a storm right now, and it might be nasty, it might have been very difficult for you to come into this place today and maybe you're struggling with some bitterness today. And I want to remind you that in the middle of this. If we allow ourselves to surrender, whatever storm were facing right now. I want you to hear this, your faith will grow roots. Your faith"
" Will grow roots in the story that we're going over today. The passage that we're going to go over today. You're going to notice two things one. It's kind of come to an answer is who is Jesus? Who is Jesus and are the storms. I face allowing me to deepen my faith little background. I always like to read and give you guys a little context about where we're going. If you go and you read this story like this story, this passage it was retold."
" Three different times in three different gospels, they call it the synoptic gospels, right? Matthew, Mark, and Luke. And here's, I'm going to give you a little bit about what was said before it was told in Matthew, right? Here's what it says in Matthew, Jesus tells his disciples that there's a cost to following him right before this. Passage. How about this in Mark? Jesus tells the parable of God's kingdom is like a mustard seed, right? As Tiny as"
" It might be it grows into one of the largest garden plants, where Birds perch and it provides shade. You think he's trying to say something to his disciples. How about this? If you go through Luke, he says this. He tells his disciples that his mothers and brothers are those who hear God's word, and he put them into practice when the storm comes, which it will inevitably do in your life. How"
" Is God's word applied, how is it lived out? Where does faith sink its roots and say we're here? And Jesus is with me. Mark, fourth is where we are today. If you guys have your Bibles, go ahead and turn the mark for, if not, you can see it on the screen and we read it together real quick before. 35 is where it starts."
" That day, when evening came. He said to his disciples, let us go over to the other side. I just notice who said this, it wasn't, it wasn't one of the disciples, right? Jesus says, let's go to the other side. Leaving the crowd behind. They took him along just as he was in the boat. There were also other boats with him, a furious. Squall came up and the waves broke over the"
" Out. So that it was nearly swamped and I want you to imagine this all of a sudden, they begin to retell this story of Jesus, led them into a boat. They are next into a storm, waves are crashing over. There's, I mean, people are scared here. The probably even saying to themselves is this really part of the plan, right? But listen keeps going. Jesus was in the stern sleeping on the cushion."
" And the disciples woke him and said to him, teacher, don't you care if we drown? Now, notice notice kind of how they say things, because it's going to come into play in a little bit. Don't you care if we drown? He got up and he were he rebuked the wind and the waves. And he said, in three words, quiet be still, listen to what happens next because this is great."
" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. He said to his disciples, why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
" And look, it says they were terrified, and they asked each other. Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him, right to fears, right? One fear is, oh my goodness were about to drown, right? A legitimate fear, the next. The next is, oh, my goodness, who is this? You know, when you break that down in Greek, the way it breaks down is"
" Is referent in all. This is a in all type of fear. What just happened, we've never seen any thing like this. Chances are some of you have stories that you could tell where you said God showed up here. God strengthened my faith that they are That season or that year. Listen our sermon innocence is really simple. Faith grows."
" Rose in the storm. Our faith grows in the storm again. Nobody likes the storm. All right, I go back and I think about this, but storms caused our roots to dig deeper, and it has us run closer and further to Jesus, it's no wonder that Jesus leads the way to the storm in this story, really? You think about this? Do you trust me?"
 Do you trust me?
 Do we trust him? It's a big word. That's a word that many of us have a hard time with because we've put hope and trust in faith into many things in this world and let me be honest with you guys. We've been let down
" And then Jesus, here we are. Look, Jesus leads the way, are you telling me that Jesus is leading the way into this storm? And I'm telling you this absolutely, he is in this storm right here. Look, there's some that. Let me just go ahead and say there are some storms that Jesus did not lead the way that was not, that was not his way. But listen, I will say this, it still works the same"
" In the middle of the storm. There is Jesus, Mary. It goes like this. Jesus is giving these guys this faith building exercise. You ever done a ropes course. Like maybe you're on some kind of leadership team. Are you work with a team and they drag you out to a ropes course? Here's some things you discover, right? You usually always find a leader, right? Somebody that like everybody else."
" Is everybody else is like snapping on each other and then finally somebody's like, hey hey right here, right here. We got to get through. This are we're going to be out here for hours and we're going to miss lunch, right? We need that leader, right? There's also this this that comes into play. There's always a point on a ropes course where there is a faith that you have to place in somebody else, right? I mean, the famous one is the trust fall. You remember some of you"
" Trust is not that hard. You'll wrap your arms. Just like this and fall back, right? Where some of you have already asked you to do that. You're like not a chance. I trust. No one, right? And here's the, here's the truth that probably plays out very well in your life too."
" I go back and Jesus leads the way in this amazing trust exercise. Jesus is directing these guys Into the Storm read that with me again in for 35. It says, this, that day, when evening came, he said to his disciples, let us go over to the other side. Make no mistake about it. Jesus knew what was coming. He knew that there was a storm and these guys were about to go through it and their lives would forever. Be changed. It would never"
 Never be the same. There Are Places Church. There are places that Jesus will take you that you will refuse to go through by yourself.
" But once going through it, your roots begin to dig in and you come out of this story different than the way you started, right? I go I go back and I keep thinking about this after this storm they realized who Jesus was. Jesus was no longer just a Rabbi, he was no longer just a teacher."
 Jesus was God.
" Jesus was somebody that they could put their hope in their trust in even in the storm. This, they think about this, this began to change the whole thought process of there is a cost to following Jesus."
 And it is uncomfortable.
 And it's not always easy.
" And sometimes If we're honest with ourselves, it's absolutely scary."
" And also, sometimes I wouldn't choose this path, you know? I'm talking about like that, that trust exercise, that Jesus has you on right now. A lot of you if you're anything like me, I want to go this far, right? And that's all I'll do right? Sometimes Storms Come and then afterwards, you're like good night. I survived that. Right? And you look back at it you're like wow, God is so good. He showed up. Look what he did, I think."
" This losing my control, jesus takes us places so that we have to lose our control. Sometimes think about this how wonderful is? This is so cool. Jesus Takes these guys who were fishermen, right? Y'all remember what? What Jesus did? What was he like? He was a carpenter, right? He built stuff. He built things like boots and chairs and I don't know like whatever things happen with wood right. But here's the deal, the carpenter tells the fishermen to get into a bow"
" Go and to go into the storm, he takes them to a place that they're actually really, really familiar with and guess what happens. And he says, how much do you trust me? Because I'm going to take what you're familiar with and I'm going to rock your world."
" Meaning this some of you some of the storms that you face, right now they're just everyday, storms are things that you're that's happening right now in your life. That you know what? You're normally really good at handling, but there will always be things in life that will come and trip. You up. There will always be storms, that will come from time to time. My friends, listen, Jesus is there. He takes people in a place that they were comfortable in and he"
" Still shows up when control was lost. Isn't that cool? Let's start reading some of this. Go back and read it with me, Mark for 37 and 38."
" A furious Squall came up and the waves broke over the boat and it was nearly swamped. Jesus was in the stern. He was sleeping on a cushion and the disciples woke him and said to him, teacher, don't you care if we drown? Can I just pause real quick. Anybody with kids, sit back and you sit back and we say things like this, it's not that you can't say this, right? It's not that you can't talk. It's how you."
" Say it yawns. I'm not anybody with kids. It's about how you approach this. It's about your tone. It's about the question you asked, right. One is a question out of bitterness. One is born out of a question of fear. One is born out of uncertainty, one. Sits back and says, hold up. What, what are you thinking? What are you doing? God, anybody ever been there? Mmm."
" Right? Where if you were to switch this and this is where Jesus comes back at them early or later on if you were to switch this one shows faith,"
" Jesus. You are who you say you are. Jesus, help me Jesus, Save Me. Jesus, I know you're good."
" I know you care for us, save us. Do you see a difference in tone? A difference of question, a difference of faith?"
 This was difficult. This was scary.
" Any other time, these guys would have been off the water. They wouldn't have found themselves here. As a matter of fact, as experienced fishermen, you would imagine that at some point, they would have said it's time to go in."
" At some point, maybe this storm came on really, really fast. They would have known what to do, but they have lost their control. But listen, even in the midst of uncertainty, where do they turn?"
" Still turn to Jesus, maybe the wrong question, maybe the wrong tone. Maybe not in faith, but where do they go?"
 They know this.
" They come to know and they come to see Jesus in a light more different than ever before. Their story changes this day, who they believe Jesus was changes. This day, think about this. Only God can control the weather. Only God."
 Jesus had done some cool stuff already. I mean he taught really really well and he was saying some stuff that we really really like and he was healing people which we all love right. But this day they took them in a place that they're familiar with he took what was familiar and he made it not ordinary. He took what was familiar and he turned it upside down and he made them question. How are we going to get out of this?
 Only Jesus.
 I love. I love how this changes the disciples because listen there was another way there's another. Wait look I I read another article this week I had read something where someone else decided that there was no other way. And here's the deal. We're talking to a room this big and I feel like Satan has a way of whispering to us.
 That there's no other way. The walls are caving in and you don't feel like you can get out of this. I read another article this week of somebody that took their own lives.
 That thought to themselves. How on Earth do I get out of this?
" And I want you to understand, please church, I want you to hear this."
" Jesus, he cares desperately for you."
 He loves you.
 He thought he knew about you when you were in your mother's womb he saw all those sweet little fuzzy hairs that you came out with and that goofy little grin right like
 He loves you.
" There is a way out of this and it is through Jesus who calms the storms, but even if"
" You go down this way. Think about this, whatever, not not, not through that. I let me, let me just go back, just a little girl move forward, but Jesus quiets the storm and gives a voice to his disciples."
" In the middle of this. Here's the deal. When you feel desperate, when you feel lonely, when you feel like there's no hope when you feel like giving up I want you to know this. That's the place Jesus works best. Please give that a shot whatever you're facing whatever you're going through. Jesus quiets the storm with these gentlemen but then he gives voice to them as well. The storms that you're facing today, listen they will eventually fade the disciples. Listen they left."
" The situation feeling more alive than when they left the shore that day. The story was such a big deal that Mark and Matthew and Luke. They all wrote about it and you bet it made an impact because going through something that that's that is life-threatening, where you thought you were about to die. You're gonna tell the world about it when you're saved."
" Look this rock their world. This was unlike anything they had ever faced or anything that ever seen, they would live to tell about this story over and over and over again. When they're around campfires. Yeah. Matt like sometimes we almost forget that these were just normal guys. You imagine like sitting around sometime when Jesus is gone and there as they're out here, building these churches to do you remember when we almost drowned, right?"
" You give me around some of my buddies from time to time. We always tell goofy stories of of crazy situations. And then we're like, and we lived through that, right?"
" Listen. Of course, these storms. They build our faith. They can build our stories and our testimonies about the strength of what Jesus brings and what he brings us through. Listen, go back. Look at verse 39 and 41. It says he got up and he rebuked the wind and he and the waves. He said quiet be still and then the waves died down and it was completely calm and he said to the disciples why are you"
 You afraid.
 Singing to himself. I'm with you.
 Do you still have no faith?
" They were terrified and they asked each other who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him, the disciples Faith. Grew that moment a trust was built that day that Mustard Seed, Faith, that Jesus had previously talked about was beginning to arise and build and grow, and it was being grown, listen, not under a perfect weather conditions, not even,"
" The perfect sunlight. It was being grown in the storm with the wind and the waves. It was being born in chaos. It was being born in the middle of losing control. They came back that day and was able to answer who Jesus was. This was God, even the wind's and the waves obey him. But not only that, I can trust him here."
" I can trust him here. Look, I how do you face a storm? How do we face a storm? I think it's, it really comes down to this. We stop looking at resistance as a destroyer of our faith. Stop looking at all the storms is something that's just out to knock you out and you're not ever going to make through that. Look at it instead as something that can grow your faith. Hey again some of us we get so caught up in asking this question. Why God why?"
" You doing this to me. Instead, he wants to transform our minds and our hearts like Peter writes about and he says stop asking that and start asking the question of what can I learn here."
" What are you trying to teach me and then you know what, maybe even take a lesson from what he tells the storm be still and listen."
" Go back and you walk through this when facing fear and frustration because of a storm retrain, your thoughts with G, with with you with you, you have Jesus. You no longer have to be fearful of whatever storm or wind or wave may be coming. Because the cross guys, listen, death lost, its sting, even if"
" Look in the middle of that. Listen and whatever else might come, whatever storm you might be facing, it will eventually pass. Jesus told us that he will not leave us and if we wholeheartedly believe this then it changes us."
" It changes our next step, right? And said, next time you come up to a storm instead of sitting back and just saying I'm not going. You take the next step towards it and say Jesus, you're with me."
" Right, it changes our step. Look, listen. If you go out and you live like that, believing that Jesus is with you, knowing that he's capable of knocking down Giants. Would you give would you live? Would you love more even in the middle of a storm instead of withdrawing, when you face the Giants of this world, that begins to throw at you, would you sit back and meet them with expectations, that your Giants will fall and waves will calm"
" and would you be okay, even if you fail"
" There's this place in Daniel with, with three guys. Shadrach Meshach, and Abednego. They were faced in this Kingdom. Their Kingdom had been taken over. They had been prisoners."
" And there's this moment where this King builds this Idol and he's like you got to bow down to it and these guys listen every time all these others would hit their knees. But not these guys, they were brought to the king. He's like you do this. You do this or I'm going to throw you in this fiery, furnace. You guys might remember this story. They make it seem really nice when you're in BBS, right? But but listen, the truth of the matter, we sing a song about this today. There's another in the fire."
" Right standing next to me. Listen, here's the deal. Listen to what they come back at the king. If we're thrawn into the Blazing furnace, the God, we serve is able to Deliver Us from it, amen? Church listen, all you gets better."
" And he will Deliver Us from your Majesty's hand, but even if church say that with me, but even if because this is, this is where it's hard for us. But even if he does not, we want you to know your majesty that we will not serve your gods, that we will not worship the image of gold that you've set up."
" We will not bow down to the things of this world that is not us. We are going to hold tightly to you, Jesus."
" Think about that. They chose God and chose God. Throw us in there. They said, God will protect us. But even if he doesn't, we refuse to Bow storms. Have a way of pulling out what we trust in. You ever notice, look, you ever have like you went through life with some folks and then you went through a storm with somebody but you find out who's with you and who's not with you real quick, you know, I'm talking about but by the time you hit the shore next time."
" Get out of here, right?"
" But how about this? There's some things that you go through just life in general, when you go through a storm, you find out what you trust in. Do, I trust in me? Do I trust in my plan? My will my hopes or do I trust in Jesus?"
" Storms, have a way of drawing that out surviving storms, allow us to retrain our thoughts. When you come out of that storm, you might realize who really has your back and what's important. Jesus being the way, the truth, and the life, it becomes real and evident once you've walked through enough storms, amen,"
" Things become less important but your faith begins to dig deep. Listen. What do you have that? You need to release because that's the challenge today. What do I have that? I need to release. Maybe it's bitterness all man. Bitterness is this poisonous pill, right? And some of us look, we're stuck in taking it every single day. We take that whatever we bring to the table, we should we take it and we swallow every day. How"
 Could they do that to us?
" How dare they do that to us, right? And you think about these disciples man? They're absolutely battling. This thing about this, they're hopping on this boat because Jesus told them to go on the boat there, in the middle of this storm. Waves are crashing. It's starting to take on water. And you know, what very easily. I could see bitterness playing a role here. You know what that George is at home? Right now? Next to a fire right with his family. He's riding this storm out, not me."
" I'm out here. Just I'm cold, I'm miserable, I'm wet and I'm trying to survive. Bitterness plays a role in what their response was to Jesus. It builds up and it lets down. Bitterness leads to anger which leads to more hurt today. Maybe bitterness is what comes up here for you. How about this? Maybe it's comparison. Look, I'd imagine that the disciples are sitting back in there. Thinking how on Earth did this happen? There's a cost to follow."
" Jesus, but other people just seem so comfortable. I could just stay in my Lane, right? I know this is one that we all deal with and then you start doing things like this. They just seem so happy, right? I mean like you look at their yard and you're like, you know what, they have, like the guy that comes in, he likes, praise the fertilizer, sweet stuff on their yard. That grass is green."
" and then you look at your yard and you're like,"
 you look at all the little cute plants they have and it distracts you listen. Here's what this does it distracts you from what the dogs leave behind?
" And over time, what you begin to do you take your focus off. What is yours is sweetness than gratefulness that God calls you to, and you look to the other person Jarred and you know what begins to happen. You stop watering what's over here. What happens when you start winding? Stop watering stuff. It dies. And you find yourself in a in a family emergency saying, why? God?"
 We stop watering. We stopped paying attention gratefulness. Maybe comparison is what comes up here for you today? How about this? What about surrender?
" What about surrender? You my friend? Listen? You've come here long? Yeah, it's been hard. You have put this off long enough. You have fought so hard, you know what you did really good, but the truth of the matter is, it was never enough and it'll never be enough. And this led you here today, Jesus is putting this on your heart Jesus wants you to know this story is All about that. He is God and you are not."
" He proves it to his disciples here and he proved it again on the cross. My friends think about this. He's only, God could stop the wind and the waves and only God could stop. The storm. Only God can lead us to the way of Heaven. Only God is the truth. Only God is the life and the only way and he had mrs. And John, I know it sounds crazy but today my hope is that maybe somebody out here, maybe you walked in here today with your"
" Steering and saying, you know what? This is the day that I give up me and my will and my trusting in me and this is the day, I surrender to you. Jesus."
" Today. Today, maybe some of you release your life in your hand. It over to Jesus. Maybe today some of its just send, maybe your rights in up here. Maybe you turn from sin, maybe you turn from sin and turn towards Jesus. Maybe for some of us look, you've been battling this whole Next Step thing and obedience. You've given your life over to Jesus. You're trying to do this for for whatever reason, you're fighting off the being obedient into"
" Some for Jesus, by the way, May 16 to Sunday's for now we're having a baptism Sunday. Look anybody can show up here if you'd like to sign up or bring friends do that, you do that at the connect a war combined."
" Unff? No, and run towards the one that is healer, the calmer of storms. The one that makes waves sees the one that leads to life and Eternity. The one that brings goodness and great instead of bitterness and comparison. He wants to free you from that church."
" Let's do that today. I want to invite you guys, feel free in this song. Write something down. Put it up here. We're going to do something really cool with that stuff. At the end of this series, something that you want to release in hand over to God. Let's pray, Jesus. Thank you. Jesus, we surrender. Jesus, we love you. Jesus, we give up and we given to you. We love you today. Love you forever working on Words, be with us in the storm. See"
" Us through this, allow us to have home when we feel like there is none. Amen."
 Church the stand on our feet as we close in song today.
 You soap in my heart to bring me apart. I need to open my eyes. I see that you're shaping my life don't.
 to trust what you say that your
" I'm broken inside the sing. This, as I, maybe we."
" The maybe we just Spirit strong. In me, my flesh May Fail, but my God, you never will sigh. Maybe we your spirit strong, in me. My flesh, may fail. My God, you never will to Give Me Faith."
 To trust. What you say? That you're good. Your loan is great. I'm broken inside. I give you my trust. What you say?
" That's your, your loan is great. I keep I keep in mind."
 Thank you.
" Then that needs to be our response to what Jesus does in our life, is to give him our lives and allowing him to work through us and do those amazing things that he wants to do, you know, I think sometimes it's probably easier for Jesus to make the winds and waves stopped and to get me to do what he wants me to do, and it shouldn't be that way. All of us are created in His image. So it's following after what he wants us to do, and all we have to do. So father, give me the faith to do it."
" Then he will. So that's our prayer for you this week is that you will each and every day. She's Faith over fear because we're putting our faith in the God who could do it all the God, who sent his son to die for each and every one of us before you leave. Today, let me remind you of a few things. First of all, as Kevin mentioned, except May the 16th two weeks from today is baptism Sunday, we would love to keep that pool busy that day. So if that's something you've been praying about"
" If that's something God is talking to, you talk to us, come to the connect table, however, it needs to happen. Even if you decide that morning, we'll take care of it. We're excited about that. A also on May 16th is our next new members class. So we would love if you've been checking us out and you're like, I need to know more about this place. Come join us for new members class 12:30. We'll provide lunch will provide child care if needed. Learn more about who we are. We would love to let you know. And then finally vacation."
" Our school is almost here and for some of us that kind of scares us, it gets us a little excited. At the same time that is a huge week, June the 14th through the 17th. You want to be a part of that even if you don't have kids come and be a part of it, we have places for you to work. We will have things. If you want to donate before the week starts, it is a huge week and it's done by the church and we would love for you to be a part of that. So mark that we could on your calendar, start praying, now for it."
" And just see how God wants to use you that week. Thank you for coming today. We are so glad that you're here. Come back and join us next Sunday. But as for now go and Faith, we're dismissed"
"Good morning, everybody. Listening to our feet, and begin to Worship the Lord a new song."
"You're the only answer to the darkness. You're the only right among the wrong. You're the only hope of monkey boys. Calls me louder than Eli. My sword hitting every find, the truth will take place."
"Your name over the target for the captain's, Mercy For The Broken, your name is in the struggle, my he will let us know his name."
Your name is Howard.
" I don't know, it is written for certain. I know that the word never fails, I know that in every situation you speak the power to prevent louder than rely, my sword in every fight, the truth will chase away,"
 Darkness struggle. He will let us know your name.
" You speak. You scared of darkness by the rising Heaven opens. Holy spirit. Let us hear it. When you speak the church way, we believe that change is coming. Holy spirit. That is see you. Speak it scared. The holy spirit."
 That change is coming. Holy spirit. Let us see.
" Your name is, your name is how your name is Amy. Thank you so much for being here this morning to give the Lord a hand maybe season."

" With you and see if there's a way you can get plugged in here at Lakeside Church. You do see a lot of students in the front of the room. We had a great weekend of disciple now weekend this year. If you don't know what D now is it's a weekend where our students we get together with about five, other churches in the lake area and we have worship small groups. They stayed at Host homes. So if, you know, their hosts home leaders by McAfee, give them a pat on the back. Say, thank you so much because one of our hosts, Psalms had a 14, 14 of our"

" Every want to see where it goes. Look up in the front of the room today. And you see these students disciple now is an event that can only take place because of your radical generosity. And the ways that you give and the ways that you support this church, support our children's ministry and they support our student Ministry and an awesome way. And this is just a week where you can literally look right out in front of you and see that. And so we just want to say thank you so much. We have three ways to give here at Lakeside and they're all on the envelope in the back of the seat. And so you"

We collect our tithes and offerings today use those as you see fit to continue to advance your gospel message to the ends of the"
" The Earth be was a be with us in this service. Be with the worship team. Be with pastor Kevin, as he brings the message open. Our hearts open, our minds and allow us to hear from you. It's your name we pray. Amen."
" Anton's journey and getting lost by mistake. What looks to me like mean his his canvas for your strength, my story isn't over. My story has just begun if you want to find me. That's what my father does. Oh feel, you want to find me? That's what my father does."
 Check his shame and sin ain't welcome anymore.
" It's not where you are. Everyone, perfect. You just wanted my hand. The story isn't over. If the story is never find when fathers in know, Viv never find all"
" Sling. Why love is on take place? Oh, Jericho. Wild prey strongholds now. Shake it."
 Check your shape.
 He's down. Check your shit. Out the door. You're sitting. Welcome in Ybor in the father's house.
" This weekend, I had the wonderful pleasure to lead in these students in worship, man, just to see, kind of the start of how things went on Friday night to see the freedom that these kids have throughout the week and many churches uniting as one to come together under the common. Cause of Christ is really special."
" What a great group of students. A great ministry is going on here. I'd like. So, it's something we talked about this week. This song Run to the father was a song that we sang a lot, this weekend."
" I want you guys to know that, as our last song talked about the prodigals coming home. This song says the same thing that we should come home to the father, when the prodigal son was gone, he found himself at the lowest of the low eventually living with pigs saying, man, my father's the worst people in My Father's House are doing a lot better than I am."
" When that prodigal son, came home, his father was looking for his father was looking for him and then he ran to him. So today you may be in a place where you say, man,"
" You don't know what I've done. You don't know where I've been. You don't know the sins. They got a grip on me right now, but God does he's still looking for you? He's still running after. He's ready to get that ring in that robe out. Say, welcome home, son or daughter?"
 So today our prayers that you would cast your cares at the Throne of God just say I can't do this alone. God I need you sing a song. This is I'm carried a burden for too long on my dime wasn't real.
" It's been very long. I hear you're into a sheet to let it all go dice in a lake. And I know that,"
 The reason to wait my heart. Needs a surgeon. So needs a friend. So I'll run.
" Mike and I had a plan from the Stars, your son for Redemption, the price for my heart that I don't have a contest."
" For that kind of love, I don't understand can't comprehend. All I know is run to"
 My heart has been.
 Long before my first breath running into is running to life from the top. This right deep in my chest do Mercy is God's justice.
" and I know,"
" Pull out onto the fight for me, I'm done with no reason to wait."
 Father this morning wherever where I met the comfort of the Holy Spirit know that there is healing. There is Restoration in a relationship with you.
" We love you, we thank you for that. You'd only see our sins God, you see the cross God, we see our sins. Pray, she was show us the resurrection that you've defeated. All of those things you call us into a deeper relationship with you."
" Plus Kevin is he comes preach your word today. That it be a mouthpiece for you. Today, we love you. Thank you for everything that you do in the life of this church. And life of every individual here today, Jesus name, amen?"
 All right. Yeah.
" Hey here's here's what here's what I'm discovering is this we all have stories? Like all of us you come in with a story and it's really cool. This has been a fun series just so I've been able to hear your stories and how you came to know, Jesus, but here's the day, I want you guys to know you're not alone. Like I hope that some of these folks, they're saying things in your like you know what the hits a chord with me. That's me. You know what I love about that is not everybody has to be the prodigal son to come to know Jesus, right?"
" Yeah, I mean, that's, that's awesome. Like, I, I sit back and I love, I love just the sincerity and the, the sweet obedience because of Grace found in Jesus, in that story. Hey, look, I don't know if you heard one of those songs. That last song we saw it, We Sing My Heart needs a surgeon. My soul needs a friend. I don't think we could pick Better lyrics for where we're camping out today. I'm not sure if anybody's ever had surgery. I've had"
" jury a timer to absolutely despise it, don't suggest it unless you got to look at what one of my last surgery procedures that I tried to be Shaun, White on the slopes, didn't turn out. Well, for me, you not breaking my wrist, I had to go get this looking at looked at and here's where I've discovered. Yo, look, it's all right. When you first show up, right? Like the surgery itself is not super painful, it's okay. And then you wake up, write like and it's miserable."
" Right? Like your stomach's a little icky. I'm sorry if anybody's having surgery real soon, I'm sorry, I'm not paying a great picture. It's wonderful. No. So like here's the deal for a little while. Here's what they do, they put you in a brace, so like the surgery, and then you have the brace that follows that and then here's what they bring next. These little demons. Now listen, now if your physical therapist, I love you. Right. But like you guys like"
" All of a sudden you're bending my hand and places didn't even start out that way, right? Like that's what I discovered. So through that process a and here's here's what I know, they can push those limits because they know that it's possible. Here's the deal. You have a story inside of you that right here, in right here. You may not feel like it's possible but Jesus says, I have more for you."
" Jesus says and do know what you feel like is not possible. Is possible through me. Amen. Look, and here's what I love about that. That last part. My soul needs a friend"
" As we start reading this, if you have your Bibles, go ahead turn to Mark to we're going to start at verse 1. If no Biff, no Bible, no big deal, just check it out on the screen. But you'll see this whole story starts with a set of friends and it changes the entire story line because of the friends. And so we're going to dig in here really cool. Mark 2 1 through 12. It says this a few days later when Jesus"
" In entered Capernaum. That's the first time I pronounce that right all day long. Just kidding. Right. The people heard that he had come home they gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door and he preached the word to them. Some men came bringing to him, a paralyzed man carried by for them and since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd."
" And they made an opening in the roof above Jesus, by digging through it. And then lowered the mat, the man was laying on timeout who called State Farm in this situation, right? Like, hey, like, do you guys know? I'm a just be a little open with you guys. There are some stories that I read and I'm like, I don't know if I have OCD. I have some weird Tendencies, so like immediately."
" I read this story and I'm like, What's the homeowner say, right to you got some really strong friends to dig a hole in this roof. And then lowered this Joker down. All right, I'm sorry. Let the add stop and let's start digging in again, okay? When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man. And by the way, notice this, when Jesus saw their faith"
" There, their faith."
" He said to the paralyzed man. Son, your sins are forgiven. Now, listen, you guys know there's always somebody super religious in a crowd like this. Somebody say no, no, you can't quite do that. So look if we get to hear from them. So it says, now some teachers of the law were sitting there thinking to themselves. Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming"
 Who can forgive sins but God Alone. Hello. God's right here in front of them and they're missing it by a mile.
" Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts and he said to them. Why are you thinking these things? Which is easier to say to this paralyzed, man. Hey, your sins are forgiven or to say this, get up, take your mat and walk, but I want you to know the son of man has the authority on Earth to forgive sins. So he said to the man I tell you,"
 Get up. Take your mat and go home. So he got up and he took his mouth.
" And he walked out in full view of them. How cool is this like straight up worship party? Breaks down right here, like it starts. People are getting into. It says is this amazed everyone and they praised God saying, we have never seen anything like this church? Are we living lives? Where, when we come in contact with people, they say, wow."
" I don't know many people like this, you're a little different. As a matter of like you like there's something different about you listen. Do we point people to Jesus, is that it? Am I a reflection of Jesus working in me? I sure hope so. I go back and I think about this, have you ever had something so heavy? You ever had a burden? Something that that was just so strong and it maybe it had a hold on. You"
" That all of a sudden, it was released knowing the ability that Jesus could remove it. Did you go to him? Did you see him remove it did healing come from it and what was the response? Listen our sermon in a sentence is this a story built on? Jesus brings healing and Direction, a story built on. Jesus brings healing and direction again. Jesus will meet you right where you are."
" But he's always going to point you someplace. Look, you don't have to, what's crazy. You don't have to know all the details. You just need to know he's pointing you closer to him, right? And he's going to point you in move you in that direction. Look, when I start reading the scripture, here's one of the first things, I think of a faithful friend points towards Jesus, a faithful friend points towards Jesus. Hold on, the Faithful Friends. Proverbs 17:17, says, is a friend loves at all times. Now anybody that has some close friends. This next part is going to be"
" Like you know what, that's it. Hey, because it says this and a brother is born in adversity, how many of you have had friends stick with you? In adversity? How many of you have had friends stick with you when it got tough? How many of you had friends? Abandon you? When tough times came? Yeah, I love that. This is the crowd. I get to hang out with today because it's such a diverse group here. Here's the deal, I could sit back and I could pull some of our son."
" Of our older Saints, you know, and talk about and y'all could preach on this. I could just move out of the way. Y'all can preach about this having friendships that are faithful in that really bring people in that stick around even in adverse situations. So, some of my younger crowd, you're seeing this play out, and you're in this place right now where you're like, listen, this is who I want to hang out with, but this is who's faithful."
" That's a, that's a hard situation. I appreciate you sharing that Riley. I go back and I think about this illustration, my, I was reading a book, one time, a guy named John wheeze, he's a pastor in Kentucky, he wrote this, he said when I was growing up, my parents were the most faithful people I'd ever seen and like, my parents had a faithful heart is what he said. It was it odd for us to be running some place on a Sunday morning, our to school. And we would be late because my dad would be changing,"
" Tire on the side of the road, right? It wouldn't be on like, like a lot of parents would discourage people to pick up homeless people from the road. My parents is what he said. My parents constantly, picked up hitchhikers and weird hitchhikers, right? He's like, he's like, it wasn't odd that my parents would bring people into our house in like from just crazy places and we would hear stories. He said, one time there was this refugee"
" E from war-torn Vietnam. And I remember, we sat down at the dinner table. Her name was cuck, said that she had Polio when he when she was younger and because of it, her leg was kind of formed a little different. It had been weakened and it was noticeable. She used to tell this story when she was in Vietnam, here's what happened. People would pinch her leg and shame her because this, they believe in reincarnation, right? And in reincarnation, they believe that in the past"
" She must have brought shame on an ancestor so they were still punishing her today. Y'all listen to this? How many of us have this label that either? Somebody tells us, we are are either. We tell ourselves, we are and we walk around and it's just this massive shame."
 How can God work in me?
 Can you can you not see that I'm a mess?
 Can you not see that? I'm broken? And was crazy. We reveal it. Like you just reveal your leg. Look at this. Look at this.
 Can God move here.
" Said that, that it was even tougher cuck because she would go out and her friends and family, that we're now in America would always say, don't you, dare go to that family's house, right. Like they're Christians, we don't do that. And she said, that one day, the so they started making fun of her. He said, listen, now some of you are going to know this because we got some strong Southern Mama's in here, praise the Lord. Right listen she said he said that I had a mama that was five foot two but us"
" You're agile, giant. You know what I'm talking about? Look is he says this, he says that my mom came in on that conversation and put it into it real quick. You know, I'm talking about, praise the Lord for people that are bold enough in their faith to put an end to where things are not righteousness, right? Hey here's here's where I'm going to keep going with this. It says that the mom had her over and that night here's what she said."
" Look, I want you to know that we have a lord and savior."
 That heals paralyzed men that takes shriveled hands and makes them whole.
" That makes people that once walked with a limp one day, perfect, restored, renewed, and gives them hope started telling story after Story and he said, the next thing I know this lady that was from war-torn Vietnam, that had always wore this label of Shane's surrendered, her life to Jesus. He says, I look forward to the day that I get to walk into heaven with her and see her walk with"
" Out a limp but just see her, right? Like, how cool is that? Hey listen, if you walked in here today, let me tell you this, you walked in here. Limping some way shape or form. Now you hide it pretty well. Like, some of you, you got it together but look, if you're anything like me, I'm just letting you know. Look, I'm a broken mess. I'm a bright. That's crazy that the pastor says, I'm a mess, right? Because here's the deal, I am without Jesus. Jesus restores me. Jesus."
" Kills me, Jesus heals me, Jesus Takes my shame, this whole identity that I built on and he says, hold up, you are son or daughter. That was pretty gross. Just in case first row here, I get into it, I get into and look, here's what I sit back and think about this, all right, as I'm starting to break this down and we dig in the scripture, turn to mark two with me again, one through four and it says this a few days."
" Later when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home, they gathered in such large numbers. There was no room left, not even outside the door and he preached the word to them. Some men came bringing to him, a paralyzed man carried by for them and since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus, by digging through it. And then,"
" Lowered. The mat, the man was lying on. If you guys were to show me the top four people, you hang out with. Here's what I could tell you. I could tell what your influence by. I could tell that maybe what some of your struggles might be. You know what, if I met the top three or four people, you hung out with, I would not even have to meet you and I could tell you a lot about your personality am I right? Yeah. Now listen mamas, mamas and daddies know this. Right? My teacher for asthma education."
" Jim friends. Y'all see this? Play out all the time, right? Anybody that's worked with teenagers, it's crazy. I remember sitting back and watching students come up. Here's one of the things I would remember. Ooh, please don't hang out with that kid, right? That sounds really bad. Like I'm glad that kid was at church, but the truth of the matter is, and you guys know this and bring you down"
" and man, it would sit back and it would break my heart because I would see students fall for these same things. Here's what I've discovered adults. You're not immune to this, not immune to this, y'all know, I still, I can get around certain adults in hold up my whole attitude shifts."
" The way I taught the way, the way that I act, and here's what I come back to is this, am I a faithful friend and do I surround myself by Faithful Friends? Because look, if I'm a faithful friend, I'm always pointing people to Jesus. I want to serve them, I want to love them. I want to call people from time to time when they come. And just like no doubt when they, when they hits my mind that I think about them, I'll usually send them a text and say, hey man, just thinking about you praying for you. Love you, man."
" Listen, faithful friendships change. How many of you have friends like that and how many of you are friends like that? Because here's what happens. All of a sudden when one of us starts doing that, guess what? We start having this community that says back and says hold up we're different now we're the church, we're outside these walls, it's different for us. These guys cared so much more their friends. They were willing to dig a hole in the roof, right?"
" Right? I have a lot of friends that pray for me. I don't know if I have any friends that would put a hole in the roof for me, right? Not even that like I don't even know if I would want to be lowered down in ra from a roof."
" I keep thinking look church if there's anything that we can offer friends and family, it's always pointing them to the Healer. It's always bringing them back to Jesus. Look, I love this. They never said, just get better guy. You know what they did? They walked with him, they walked with him. How many of you have? Righteous friends, Faithful Friends that are walking with you in."
 The struggle.
" How many even even more than that, that do you notice this in the middle of this? If you turn and you look at Matthew 9 1 through, to listen what it says, Jesus stepped into the boat crossed over and came into his own town. Some men brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a mat, and when Jesus saw their faith, he said y'all read this with me. He said, to the man, take heart son, your sins are forgiven, did you notice that? It said, their friends faith."
" He noticed the friends Faith before he even noticed. This gentleman that was lying on a mat guys. Your faith in your friends and family it matters, they took him to Jesus and they watched what Jesus did church. Pray for your friends, pray for your family. Jesus is alive, he's moving, he hears your prayers. Look here's the deal. That second thing is this Jesus makes it personal."
" Jesus makes it personal look what I think so cool about that. It seems as though this gentleman look as he was lowered down, it seems as though he was a little scared here, right? Like he was a little afraid and what does Jesus say? Hold on, take heart. This reminds me when Jesus comes out and he says, listen, he says my yoke is easy, my burden is light. I wonder if this guy, he's just upset, maybe."
" Be scared. Maybe he realizes that he's a sinful man and all over all of a sudden he's around somebody greater than he is. What if that's it, right? What if he's looking at it? Like Peter situation, where Jesus comes to Peter, fills, this boat full of fish, realizing that Jesus is able to do something. That's possible that he's not able to do. So, he stands back and he says, Lord, get away from me because I'm a simple man. Maybe that's this guy right here."
 This guy that's lying on a map.
" This mat right here. Listen, the world says this, this is your shame. This is your identity. Let me give you an example. They probably didn't go around and be like, hey, you know what? That's Jake."
 People probably said.
" Hey, you know that family that has that paralyzed kid."
" The one that can't walk the, the one you always see. Maybe you see him from time to time and he's always on that mat."
" He makes this all of a sudden is crazy. Like, this is, this is his identity. This is what he was used to, in. Jesus makes it personal. What does he call him? He doesn't call him. He doesn't call him. Hey, listen. The paralyzed kid, right? He doesn't even call him by his name. Do you know what he says?"
 Son.
" Son, take heart."
" Take heart and look, he even makes it more personal. Your sins are forgiven. Do you notice this? He deals with the heart issue before he ever gets to the physical issue."
" He deals with the burden that's in here. Some of, you know, this look, you came in the church, I say this all the time because here's the deal, you came in to church this morning thinking, oh my, what am I doing in this place?"
 Right.
" And again maybe some of you walked in here with a little bit of a limp or maybe you were Dragged In Here by your Grandmama, your granddaddy your mama, your dad, whatever that looks like and you came in here kicking and screaming. And you're thinking, oh, if they only know,"
 Here's the deal. Jesus does know.
" He does know, I love the saying Jesus. Jesus knows your sin, because you, by your name,"
 Satan knows your name because you by your sin.
 And we we listen to that we listen to that. Y'all know who I'm talking about boy we just wear that we just like listen just so you know sinful. I'm I'm not a good dude I don't even I'm only here because they dragged me here you know and then you're like this
 Here's the deal. Maybe it's this something happened to you years ago.
" You had no control over all, you had no control over and I am so. So sorry. And I'm letting you know this it breaks. Jesus heart that something like that happened to you."
 Here's what I know. That doesn't just go away.
" Maybe you made a decision. Maybe it was a reckless decision, maybe it was a weak moment. Maybe you've been living in a weak moment for a long time. And so you just say, you know what, this is just who I am. Look, it's just who I am. I'm just, I'm just doing what I'm naturally created to do and so you just wear it."
 And that's it.
" And then all of a sudden, one day you find yourself in front of Jesus and he makes it personal. And he says on daughter, take heart."
" That mistake, you made."
 That burden that's on you I can lift it please just come to me.
 Son daughter. You keep running back to this in the shame just continues to grow. I can rid you of that burden. Amen! Amen. And I come back and I just want to read read this part right here.
" I love, I love that. We get to see this Jesus. How cool is this? Jesus God in flesh, right? Like we know the whole story, the friends only knew Jesus as a miracle worker as an incredible teacher. I had they knew that fast forward. We know a little bit more to the story. We know that he's got son, we know that he went to the Cross, he lived a perfect life. Went to the Cross was a sacrifice so that we could have Heaven people."
" So that shame could die so that our identity no longer is our burden. It's no longer our pain. Our identity is Jesus, Jesus crucified. Amen. And I go back and I think about this look, Jesus begins to move beyond our pain. Let me say this. Do you go back and read that scripture with me? If you go back and look at marketing, it can we can we turn that Mark to 11 and 12. I tell you. Get up take right, Get Up, Stand."
" Up. Take your mat and go home. He leaves them with three commands, get up take him out, go home."
" Get up, take your mat and go home."
 Can I just say this? Some of us?
 Some of us you come in here.
 And here's the deal.
" Some of us were just stuck in apathy. We're just used to living like this, and this is who we are. And so Jesus, I don't need that."
" Some of us we come in here and you know, you're broken."
 And you cannot see or Envision a life where you won't feel like this.
 So we stay and we just keep hoping for hope.
 And I want you to know this. Jesus says yes.
 Stand up.
 Stand up.
" You keep struggling with with alcohol, you keep struggling with addiction. You keep struggling with pornography, you keep struggling with lust, you keep struggling, with whatever it may be."
" Jesus says, you do not have to keep this stand up. Francine makes it personal the first step for some of us in walking out. Our faith is this right here."
 Stand up believing that Jesus can take what we've done.
" Our burdens are shame and we can simply stand up. Now, some of you been living in the stand-up moment for years. You brought him in, he's you he's your savior."
" But this sweet obedience that comes from the grace of the Cross is something that we're struggling with guys. Here's the second command. You remember, get up"
 Take your mouth.
 Take this this shame. This burden. This label. This whole thing that people said that you are
 take it.
 Take your mouth.
" Take your burden, take your shame."
" There's this thing that comes with obedience surrender to this grace that God gives us where all of a sudden. This whole thing that used to define me all my struggles, all my addiction, all my doubts, all whatever fill-in-the-blank. All my bad decisions, the decisions that I keep seeming to make this whole past of something that happened to me, this abuse, this whatever fill-in-the-blank. Here's the deal, there's a lot of it."
" And I want you to realize this, take your man."
 You don't have to lay there anymore.
" This does not have to be your identity anymore. As a matter of fact, I become your identity instead. When people look at you, they're not going to think hey you know what there's that whatever, fill in the blank instead they're going to think there's that follower of Jesus there's that guy or there's a girl that lives out Christ. And you know what instead of this being something that all of a sudden is your identity all of a sudden you sit back and you say, Hey listen I'm leaving here today."
" No longer going to be the same but I'm gonna live this out as though, Jesus healed me. And you know what, you can have victory over this. You don't have to continue saying, hey you know what, the labels that people gave me in middle school and high school. Those things that your parents said to you, that honest-to-goodness was not wholly, and it was not godly, but it stuck with you and it's in your head. You know what you've been carrying around for way too long. Let me tell you, if you a switch up to the story, all of"
" of a sudden you say this, Look what Jesus allowed me to overcome."
 Look what I gave over to Jesus. Look how he changed me. All of a sudden. This is no longer me. It's Jesus. Amen.
" And I love what he says at the end. He doesn't say this. Hey, you know what? He doesn't just say, get up and take your mouth. What's he say? Go home, go home, parents. Grandparents students kids everybody that's in here right now, I want you to hear this. He says go home for a reason, go home, tell them what I did here for you today. You don't have to be silent about it. Look, Moses wrote about it, in the Old Testament, hang these things on the whole wall."
" Let them know that God moved in this place. Jesus constantly heals people, you know what he says? Go show everybody and immediately he says right here, go home parent. Now listen I'm going to step on some toes here and just know I love you."
" Parents. The church is a beautiful tool. It is a gift from God. Parents hear me. It is not Davis's responsibility to lead your kids. To Jesus parents, hear me out. Listen, I know this is difficult. The church is beautiful. It's a wonderful tool. It is not Carol. Ann's job to lead your kids to Jesus, you know, whose responsibility that lands on"
 You.
" And here's the beautiful thing behind it, all the gifts of Grace that you showed, your family is the same Grace that Jesus has shown you all of a sudden when you can show empathy and compassion and still walk in obedience, understand the still disobedience is sweet, it's because of Grace. We don't just leave obedience at the door and say, stay there. No, no, no, no."
" But it's walking in this sweet obedience. This is look at what Jesus has done. God's. You need this it's sitting back. Listen, you know, what's so beautiful about this? Look, we are all at, we're all broken, right? It's about saying this. You know what? This is who I was, this is what I did and it's grabbing. Your wife's hand is grabbing your husband's hand. Just grabbing your kids hand to his saying. Let's pray together. Let's walk through this together. Look there's some bottles that are going"
" On right now, help that come with me, look will lead the way. Jesus will lead the way and then we go walk differently. There's a guy named Kyle I don't mean they wrote a book is called not a fan and what I love about it is this he started interviewing parents that wish that they could have done something a little different in raising their kids. This is what I wish I would have done, this is what they say."
 We raised her to look right on the outside but we didn't teach her about the inside.
" We taught her to keep all the rules, but she never really had a relationship. We made her feel guilty for the wrong thing, she did, but somehow she miss God's Amazing, Grace."
" We taught her to be a fan of Jesus, instead of a follower of Jesus."
" Parents, we got work to do students. You guys come in here and not all your parents go to church."
" There's a there's something that Jesus is calling you to do. You have a message to bring that brings freedom to your parents? Can I just tell you this? I have watched Jesus work in my life so much that I've seen my parents come to a place in Jesus that I never expected them to go. I watch my brother who I trust me. Listen, I thought I was wild and crazy. My brother was a whole different low level of wild and crazy. You know what? I've watched him surrender."
" To Jesus, I've watched Jesus change him because of this, not because of the rules that Jesus brings into his life. But because of the freedom, that Jesus produce on the cross, that allows him to walk in obedience."
" I sit back and I think about this stand up, take your mat and go home."
" Stand up, take your mat and go home. Here's how we do this versus this. Be a faithful friend. Be a faithful friend. It really? I sounds like easy but it's not whenever you actually show up to school on Monday or work on Monday, that's not easy. Look, pray for others to come alongside you pray that the Lord gives you somebody else. So you don't have to keep walking this life out lonely."
" Pray this pray for others, encourage others in their walk text people let them know that you're praying for him. You're thinking about and second is this ask for healing that's for healing you know you have some people in your life that would show up for you sometimes if you would just be willing to ask"
" How about this? Sometimes we hold onto this so much that we just we're just comfortable with it. We're a pathetic. And so we don't even worry about asking for healing. I'm going to challenge you guys today. In the note cards that are either in front of you are right behind you. If you're on the front row, there's something that I want you guys to write down that deals with healing, that God healed me from addiction. God, be with my spouse in my relationship, be with my kids, working, maybe"
 Is a physical thing. God do this maybe even write down something for a friend if you don't have anything to write for yourself. How about this?
" God, I'm broken here."
 God's in is Big right here.
 And it's weighing me down.
 And it's a burden.
" Bring it. Write it down. Nobody has to see it. Folded up, we're not looking. Don't put your name on it unless you want to put your name on it."
 Bring it.
" Shame dies when we invite Jesus into the equation, shame dies. And the third is that whole story ends with people. Praising. Jesus, Praise Jesus, where you're at, Jesus turns, our pain in the praise. Listen to this. The mark 2 verse 12, it says he got up, he took his mouth and he walked out in full view of all them and says this amazed everyone and they praised God, they"
 Praise God saying this. We have never seen anything like this.
 Guys.
" Are we different? We're going to just look like the world. Your life can be a story that brings praise to Jesus. Let's allow that. Are you ready? We ready like we were soon we're gonna come out of these walls. Come out these doors and all of a sudden we're either going to walk back into the shame that we came in here with or we can sit back and say Jesus is all yours. We can sit back and we can say, hey,"
" Listen, here's this burden. This is me. Or we can say Jesus healed, me. Jesus heals me Jesus Takes my sins, my burdens my pains and it was finished on the cross. Some 2,000 years ago, a mentor Church. All right, all right."
" Let's pray. Jesus, I pray right now that your steering and hearts, Lord, I called people to write stuff down to put it in front of you to sit back and realize you are healer. Lord, that you can move them past the shame in their lives and they don't have to live there anymore. God, I pray for Faithful Friends. I pray that we can be faithful friends that are constantly stretching others to sit back and say come on with me. Lord I pray"
" That right now, we just praise you where we're at. That's here right now. But even beyond that, Lord, Let Us Praise You. Where we live? Where we work and where we play. Let Us Praise You as school. Let Us Praise you. Whenever we are outside of just four walls Lord, the church is Way. Beyond here. We take Church wherever we go Lord because you are with us. Let us bring our pain before you and allow."
" Oh, it to turn the praise. We love you. Jesus. Amen."
 There's a stain on our feet.
" This morning, the altars, open the boards are open here. There's a prayer. You need healing that you need to place it on the board."
 Jesus.
" And that leads to me. The thing that we remember,"
 No matter. Whether we are the one laying on the mat paralyzed.
" No matter where we are, no matter where we are, whatever person we play in this drama, we need to always remember that. God is so good. He's not good.

" Maybe let's give the Lord a hand this morning, wonderful opportunity to rest in the fact that God is good and he is working for those who have been called according to his purpose, we continued this week, our story with Lakeside stories. So today, we have a special story from the Sylvia Harrison, and if you would direct your attention to our screens, you may be seen"
" I was raised in a Christian home and was taken to church from the time. I was born and from living in a Christian home, I knew what it was to be a sinner and I also knew what I had to do to get saved. When I was 15 years old, I was attending a Revival and at the end of the service, I found myself standing in front of the pastor, looking up at him and saying, I know that I'm a sinner and I want to ask Jesus to be my Lord and Savior."
 And I also want to be baptized.
" And I know without a doubt that that was the most important day of my life and that was the best that decision that I have ever made. Because as soon as I asked Jesus in my heart, the Holy Spirit came to live within me. And each day, the Holy Spirit, just convinced me and teaches me. And when I do wrong, I know that I have to stop and say, ask God to forgive me, and help me to repent, and not to do that again."
 Live through many Mountaintop experiences and I've also lived through many Valley experiences and the valley experiences of the ones that I grew most in. I grew closer to the Lord because I knew that he was always with me. I knew that he would never leave me nor forsake me and I just want to share a couple of experiences that I went through.
" In 2009. I was at a church praying and there was a terrible storm and lightning struck my house and caused a fire and someone called and told me that my house was on fire and you can imagine just how devastated I was. But someone took me home. And when I drove up and saw all the people that were there, I just felt so loved. I just felt so loved by God that all those people would be there for me."
" And then I saw that my house had not burned to the ground that it was still intact. And I knew that God was right there. Walking through that, with me. And the next morning when I went into the house, I realized that none of my important papers. None of my precious family pictures were destroyed and then I went into my bedroom and took in my closet and found that my clothes did not smell like smoke. So I just felt like that. That was a great."
" Miracle that God had performed in my life and I am so grateful and thankful to him. And the other thing was in 2017, God made me understand that. It was time for me to give up my house and to move somewhere else and 2019, my house did sale. And I moved in to another place that God had found for me. And when covid happened in 2020, as I had to stay there,"
" Not go anywhere. I thought back over many things and saw God's hand and that to that. He had moved me because he knew that covid-19, and he did not want me to have to be down there on 37 acres by myself, with no one around me. And he took me to a place where there was lots of other people. And so I just see his hand and everything that he's"
" He's ever done in my life and he is my he is my Living Hope and I just would like to leave this with you. I just want you to know that he can be your Living Hope to and that whatever you go through God will walk through it with you and he will never leave you nor forsake you and I know that I'm going to be in heaven with him one day and I want you to have that same Living, Hope and know that you can be there with him too."
" It's great, man. If you guys know her, you want to be like her, right? Like I she's just the sweetest. Like, that's right. Yeah, listen, she has been transformed by Jesus transformed by Jesus and in the middle of that, what begins to happen that take shape and other people get to see that as well. My hope is that we can all have all be able to be transformed and have our hearts and Minds transformed by the Lord. We're still in our series."
" Of Lakeside story. So you guys will see one of those every time for the next few weeks, you're going to see somebody share their story from Lakeside. In the middle of this last week, we talked about fear today, we're going to be talking about filling our hunger and I don't know if anybody's ever been hungry, like, just starving hungry. I can't think of many times where I've been starving, but I can think of one I was, I just got through graduating. I was"
" Done with high school. I had a friend of mine, we are both 18 years old. We both thought we knew a whole lot of stuff. This was before Bear. Grylls was showing up Every Which Way, but I do remember this. We had graduated were like, hey, let's go, let's go. Live off the land. That's a terrible idea. Here's one of the things that I've learned over. This, that is so much harder than what Bear Grylls, makes it seem like we ended up going camping as we went camping."
 We packed us a tent and we brought one bag of Doritos. That's what that goes to show you how well we prepped for this trip. We just thought we would bring Doritos and we would catch fish and we would just smoke the fish over the fire and that was not smart. That's not smart. Don't ever do that. Always have a plan. So not only did we pack pack a tent but we also forgot to pack everything.
" Thing for the tent. So we got there. Our tent would not go all the way up because we did not have all the pieces and we could catch. No fish and listen, I usually know how to catch fish, that's usually not a struggle. But for this trip, I couldn't even get it like a small fish to buy anything we had. And so I know I joke the other week about a Snickers commercial you know you're not yourself when you're hungry and truly. Me and my friend who were best buddies up to this point had become enemies."
" We were just at each other's throat. It was obvious. We were sleeping in the car, we were miserable and thankfully that we had a little neighbor who was also a tent camper who was much more prepared, right? Like his him and his whole family, they had eight really, really well. And he was so nice to us and he's like, hey, would you guys like to join us and we're like, praise God, right? Yes, here's the deal. We were on The Struggle Bus."
" At this point in time, we were actually camping close by here and at this point in time. After like 8 o'clock nothing, our 9 o'clock there was really nothing. That was open. Some of you guys have been here for a while. I mean this was oh my goodness. This was 20 years ago. Oh my. Just yesterday. 20 years ago, you guys really know this. There wasn't a lot out here. If you've been out here that long and so anything that was out here was already closed. And I just remember how"
" Miserable that was and how hungry I was Hunger. Causes some reactions, doesn't it right? Hey listen, a hunger can make us. Not really who we are, but hunger, Hunger, being filled compassion and filling stomachs and hunger can actually transform our minds a little bit, can it? And I think about this is a perfect way to introduce this."
" Story because here's the deal where we're going right? Where we're going is Jesus feels our hunger. He feels our needs and it's not through our stomachs necessarily that we're talking about. This. This is this is through him in the middle of this. Here's something. Just so you guys have a little bit of a background where we're going last week. We talked about Peter walking on water Jesus. And Peter walking on water, but if you go back,"
" Just the story before. That's this story right here. Jesus, feeding 5,000. And something happens that day, right? Before that. If we give you a little bit of a background, John, the Baptist who baptized Jesus. Jesus knew John the Baptist baptizing had just been beheaded at a party, his life had just been taken. And so the story kind of starts in this somber mood"
" You know, and think about this. And usually, I don't know about you guys, usually, when I'm, when I'm hurting, when I'm struggling, sometimes my mindset isn't on others. It's on I'm hurt right now and sometimes I'm kind of lash out, right? And I, we're going to look at this story and I want us to just see what Jesus is reaction. Is here it goes. In Matthew 14, we're started verse 13. If you have your Bibles turn to Matthew 14 with us, if not, you see it on the screen, and"
" Follow along with us, okay? It says when Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat, this is what he heard. Was that John, the Baptist had passed away, he had been killed he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. There's that solitary theme again, they let's get, I need to get away, I need to be recharged, I need to be refilled. God, speaking, to me, I says, hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot."
" It from the town's when Jesus landed, and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick. I'm looked up this word, compassion, and Greek, it means to be moved from the gut, right? Like from the inside, it works its way out, he was moved by the crowd and he began to heal the sick. The first thing that we see is compassion the second, the first Hill"
" That we actually see in this is what it's Healing, The Sick. And then, it says this as evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, this is a remote place and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away so that they can go to The Villages and buy some food. Jesus replied. They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat. And now listen what you get right here, two different perspectives."
" Gives the world says this logic, right? Like, all of us would probably fall under this. It's getting late. The closest town is non miles away, Cindy's, Joker's home. We got to get out of here. I'm pretty tired anyway. So right, like you got anybody, okay? Just me. All right. Then you have Jesus perspective, Jesus flips it. And what does he say?"
" Hold up. You give them something to eat. Can you can one can you imagine? Well what do we do? Well listen. Here's a solution that I come up with, we have here only five loaves of bread. And two fish, they answered and this is powerful."
" Bring them here to me and we're going to come back to this. I want you guys to realize what you feel like is small and insignificant Jesus can use. All right, just keeps going. And says he said, bring them here to me. She said and he directed the people to sit down on the grass, taking the Five Loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave. Thanks and he broke the Loaves and he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave"
 Them to the people. This is a long day for these guys.
" They all ate and they were satisfied and the disciples picked up. Twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over the number of those that ate was about 5,000 besides women and children. So hold up, like, think about this like you're not just 5,000, you're probably estimating 1520 thousand people at this at this place. Now I"
" When I was young, I used to I still enjoy going to a concert from time to time but I mean this would be like going to Lakewood amphitheater and you sitting from the bottom and just looking up. I can you imagine and all of a sudden people are hungry, we got to do something and all of them left fed by two fish, five loaves of bread and then there's leftovers. Come on. Now, listen, here's the deal. Well, here's how this party starts, right?"
" All right, here's how this story starts in Matthew 14, there's one party that's completely all about a king, right? King Herod. It's all about me and then there's one party where it's all about others. There's one party, where you go out and you have King Herod. That invites, his really, really like, well, all friends, all the people, all the popular people. These people have names their royalty. People know, these guys and then you have Jesus."
" Like listen, we're gonna throw a party and we don't know any of y'all's names."
 You strangers?
" You have another party right here. King Herod. Listen, this party is on fire. Y'all like listen to everything, you can imagine that the world could throw right, sex drugs and rock and roll. That's this party right here."
" And then, and then Jesus is party over here. Listen, it's full of healing and teachings that are transformative. You have one party. You have one party. We King Herod. That's life. Taking"
 And you have another party that Jesus throws here and its life-giving.
" And I asked ourselves, sometimes is Jesus."
" Am I going to you for you to give me life or am I going to this world to solve to meet my needs? Here's the deal Church. We're all hungry. But what's filling our appetite? Is it Jesus, whose Life Giving are we going to this world that for right now? Temporarily listen, it meets some needs, right?"
" Like listen. All right, let's let's break this down a little bit. Some of the things that we have all hoped for, and none of these things are necessarily bad by themselves. But if this is what we use to feed us, our nice house, our white picket fence, our 2.5 kids with the sweet little dog and the white picket fence around it."
" That new gaming system that just cost you like five hundred dollars, don't worry give it two years. $1,000 on will come in the really really soon."
 Is that what feeds me?
" Here's what I've discovered when I, when I put my Hunger, when I allow that to feed me, and what I've learned is over time, all of those things fade in the years that I have followed Jesus. He continues to give me life. He continues to move in my life. He continues to meet needs that I didn't even realized I had at 16 years old."
" And only discovered that I needed them later. Isn't that wild? And he was patient with me in that process. He loved me in that process when I was a rebel and going crazy and wild. Listen, he loved me, he loved me. He was calling for me and I have a feeling that some of us, maybe that's us right now. Maybe you're not 16, maybe you're 48 years old, but here's a deal. Maybe you've been running and I just want you to hear this. Jesus feels you,"
 you've been running for a long time.
" He quenches thirst, he meets her needs he fills her stomachs, he feels a spiritually. Jesus meets our needs and that's our sermon in a sentence. Jesus meets our needs stop running for the things that we think this world will fill us with and allow Jesus to meet the needs that we have spiritually physically. Mentally. Here's the deal with this is where"
" Start the compassion of Jesus transforms me the compassion of Jesus change. People that day, The Compassion of Jesus. Where is this? He steps off the boat in this somber mood and then all of a sudden it goes from about him then and he moves this into about others, The Compassion of Jesus. So he saw people that were hurt and broken and what does he do? He heals them. He came from himself. Probably I mean,"
" Really you think about this? You we obviously know that he's probably struggling, right here, again, he's off looking for Solitude because he needs this and we know that Jesus dealt with Earthly pain. We can all agree with that. Right? Two words, probably two words but are in the Bible shortest verse in the Bible but probably some of the biggest punch that comes with it. He went Jesus wept."
" And it Jesus wept. Hold on. You're telling me that Jesus can hurt on this Earth. Absolutely. And he hurts with you, he's he hurt has her along with you. I go back turn to Matthew 14:14 with me. It says, when Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick. Jesus is compassion led him to heal people, and feel empty, stomachs"
" Where is this being played out in your life? How are we living that out? Because, here's the deal. When we meet Jesus, when we see him, fill us, when we watch him, transform us. What begins to happen? Our Lives. Begin to change. Think of it. Like this, the more time you spend with Jesus, the more you ask Jesus to wash over, you something begins to happen. It's like a river. What happens with a river, right? A river, literally can break through"
" Through Rock, it will change rock. It makes Canyons, thousands of feet tall. And you know what? It isn't because the waters powerful. It's because the waters persistent. The more you put Jesus in allow him to be persistent in your life. The more that you will begin to see things like compassion, be played out in your life. Here's the deal. Let me, let me make sure I say this if we're image Bears, if I'm supposed"
" To be image bearers of Jesus. Then that means my life is going to look like him, it's going to be transformed to look like him. Compassion, begins to move itself up top because that was something that was important to him. Maybe for some of us today. Spiritually is this? Jesus give me compassion because right now, that's mine that might not be something that's really high priority on your list. When you think of things that you need to be fed from,"
" Jesus is compassion, you know, I sit back and I think about this, there's something that kind of comes to mind. Listen, we have things Twisted. We think this, we believe that, in order to have compassion, we have to agree with people that we give compassion to write that because if not, then it's just a way. So I want you guys to realize this, this story, if you go back, look at this story in John 6."
" If you go back and you look at this story in John 6, you see that Jesus comes in here obviously and you look at Matthew 14, Jesus feeds, the thousands fast for our go, go forward. A little bit to after Jesus walks on water and Peter walks on water. The very next day they end up on the other side. Do you know what it says? Jesus starts preaching some hard stuff."
" He starts preaching some art. So he says this, I am the bread of life. Meaning this eternity comes through me, this was tough teacher, there's a lot that goes on in there, trust me. I and and honestly I don't have time to break down that whole passage because it's a whole another sermon in itself. But let me just say this, he comes out and he preaches, he starts teaching this and do you know what it says happens."
" All those thousands of people that were fed that day, that were filled left left healed. They showed up broken, he filled, he healed them."
" Showed up hungry, he filled their stomachs. Do you know what happened? When he said that he's the bread of life."
" And that he's the way to heaven. Do you know what, what begins to happen? Is this people start walking away. Do you know why?"
 Because that stuff teaching.
" You know what's crazy. He stepped off the boat knowing that tomorrow was going to come knowing that people were going to walk away from him, knowing that people were going to say nasty things about him. I would imagine"
" And it says he had compassion on them, he healed them. Anyways, he fed them. Anyways. Church, don't allow this world to twist what God's trying to do church. If there's ever a time, if there's ever a season, we need to step up and be image, bearers of Jesus. It's now it's now"
" We can't sit back and not have compassion on people, just because we disagree with them. Jesus has called you to that. Jesus has transformed you to be compassionate. I love this feed them. Anyways, Jesus did. And we're image bearers of that because of that, one of the reasons this is so nice because at some point somebody had compassion on"
" Right? Somebody had compassion on your chances. Are you showed up in the seats here today? Because somebody had in Sean compassion to you? Listen, Jesus is better. Jesus is better. Amen. Jesus is better II. Honestly, I go back and I think about this Jesus doesn't just meet our needs, he's just better. We all get caught on a caught up in this belief that we might know better and for a while that might work, right? And"
" Till you realize hold up. I am mortal. Things aren't always perfect. Sometimes Things Fall Apart. Hold up. I want things to be a little different over time. Things in this world fade things in this world, Russ things. In this, this world eventually, let me down not Jesus."
" My dad. I and sometimes that changes because of a change of environment. I have maybe some of you can identify with his. I had a parent that grew up smoking, my dad was a smoker growing up right now, but here's the deal like that, was that was it abnormal, right? Like that. Again at the end of the day, if you're a smoker here I'm glad that you're here. I'm not talking bad against that but here's the deal. I never saw it to be a problem."
" I couldn't even smell it. Like I mean, like if I'm being honest with you guys, I'd gotten to the point like I could obviously tell that things smelt different, but it just became my norm and because it was my Norm, I couldn't smell. I couldn't tell that much of a difference, right? And so like that was the environment I'm in in and think about this in our world today. Have we just gotten so comfortable with the world that we don't even recognize that it's rotting us away?"
" Maybe Jesus wants to Simply change things up because here's the deal, I went off to college and I was in a smoke-free environment for an entire year and then I moved back in with my dad for the summer. Do you know what I started? Recognizing the walls were a little yellowish, right? Like I never noticed that before, I walked through the door and all of a sudden, right? Like I'm just having a hard time breathing a little bit"
" I I remember going out, I came back. I remember just thinking I could not keep my clothes from smelling like smoke no matter how hard. I tried things had changed because my environment had changed because I had seen things differently. Listen, my friends. Jesus is so much better than this polluted world."
" What you may see right now is simply the world and you're just handcuffed by it. And Jesus is over here saying, come on, come on, come back over here."
" And I promise you this, the more that you grow in Jesus the more he's going to remove you from this broken world and bring you closer to him and all of a sudden the environment changes. You see Jesus differently. Listen, keep reading this story. What I love about this story, the disciples, the disciples were fishermen they were Tax Collectors, right? They had jobs that"
" Just let's let's just provide for the family. I'm just trying to get by on in some of us, maybe we've echoed those words. Listen, I'm just trying to get by leave me alone. Let me do my thing, right? Listen, Jesus, transform their thoughts, from just being fishermen, people that just trying to get by people that were Tax Collectors, that were trying to cheat their way by and provide for their family. And he transforms them into compassionate men that instead of fishing like this instead of"
" Ed of tax collecting and cheating people. All of a sudden they're sitting here in this deserted place while Jesus is kind of in this Solitude place in this somber moment and all of a sudden they're saying, hold up, their lives are being transformed. Now, they're looking at people and saying Jesus, we got to feed these people."
" They've been transformed. Everything looks different now, their environment, they've been following Jesus for a while now. They've watched him. He'll people. They've watched people's lives be changed because of him. Things were now different. They want to feed people but they don't know how"
" Only Jesus, because Jesus is better. Listen, it keeps going Matthew. 14 15. It says as evening approached. The disciples came to him and said, this is a remote place. It's already getting late."
" So they can go to The Villages and buy themselves some food. Again, the thought isn't so much about themselves. It's we got to take care of them. Jesus replied, they do not need to go away and this is I love this phrase. Can you all read this along with me? You give them something to eat. How about this? Jesus doesn't just say, hey I'm going to do all this by myself. He invites us along in the"
" To say what you thought you were not capable of, I am so, come along with me and less feed some folks."
" That's right. Amen. Look whoever's in the back. You just keep going, right? Listen, our Solutions are solutions are not always what's best. It's what we think might be best. Our Solutions. Often revolve around us, Jesus wants to transform our minds and say, no, it's not about you, it's about me, man. When they go back and look, the look at this, it's getting late. The disciples are looking down at their watching their, they can hold up."
 This we gotta do something about this. Jesus is better.
 Jesus made a miracle with what was available. Thousands of people were fed off this kid's lunch of to fish and five loaves of bread. It went from being a lunch for a single person or maybe a couple of people to feeding a feast of thousands. Here's the deal church. We get to be a part of that. We still get to be a part of this.
 Jesus says this come as you are give me what you have? Let me transform you let me do more with your little brain. What you have and let Jesus begin to be the solution. Jesus doesn't just meet needs. He does it abundantly church. He does it abundantly. He is a god of abundance go. If you have
 I was you can turn to if not it will be up on the screen John 6 12 through 13. This is this is John's version of the the feeding of 5000
" When they had all, when they had all had enough to eat. So everyone was filled, everyone was happy. He said to the disciples, listen gathered, the pieces that are left over. Let nothing go to waste, who write like a kind of steps on some toes, a little bit, I sit back and I think look after this, let me just be honest with you. It's been a long day. I'm kind of tired. Look, I did my job. Whoo."
" Like, let's let the birds take care of the bread, right? Jesus is like, no, no, there's still some left over, and this isn't meant to be wasted. I go back. And I think through they keeps going. It says, so they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. So, it went from five to twelve basketfuls God,"
" God is a god of abundance. He takes what we can offer him in our time and our ability and our resources and it multiplies. Its Effectiveness beyond our expectation. If you, if you are willing to take the first step, if you're willing to start taking a step towards Jesus, making your stuff and your yourself available for God, he will show you how greatly that you can be used to."
" It is the work of his kingdom. Do not let things go to. What's a waste. That's a strong passage about being wasteful. Listen, you guys are called to be good stewards and what that simply means is this, we are not men. We are meant to be managers of what God has given us, right? And so, they're there again, what what are you doing with the gifts and the talents, the abilities, the resources that God has allowed you to have"
" Have is it is it all about me or is it hate Jesus? Whatever I can do for the kingdom? It's yours, it's yours. Those are two different type of management ways of handling stewardship is. So listen. I want to make sure that we understand stew."
" Jesus. It, if you if we can come to the conclusion that God can do big things with our what may seem small to us than it changes. The way, I spend my time and the way that I spend my resources Jesus had use for what was left over and he collected. What was left over? He collected it for a reason. Listen I again how here's here's where it all."
" Comes back down to if Jesus is better. If this chant is his compassion changes me, if Jesus meets my needs. Well, how do I put that into play in my life? Here's here's one thing that we can start with. Just simply bring what you have, bring what you have. This whole Feast was started with five loaves of bread. And two fish, it went from a lunch to an entire Feast of feeding thousands."
" God can do so much with your little. You may feel like you're insignificant or like, you don't have a ton. Listen, Jesus simply says, surrender it to me. Watch, watch me, watch me. What do we hunger for? Do we hunger for that? Here's another thing. The second is this believe, Jesus is greater than the circumstance. You face believe Jesus is greater than the circumstance, you face, some of you. What's staring?"
" You right now you're looking out and what staring you can't see what's in front of you because you see this Giant mountain in front of you, right? And whatever that looks like, here's the deal. I mean, that could be anxiety, that could be depression, that could be some type of sin that could be whatever, fill in the blank."
 Here's what I've discovered.
" What I've understood is this there's a reason why Jesus says, look at that mountain over there, you can have faith to look at that mountain right there and you can tell it to move."
" Pretty soon. Listen the more the closer that you follow Jesus. The more that you're willing to sit back and say Jesus you meet my needs. Here's what we discover sooner or later you're sitting on a Mountaintop and you're looking around in your thinking. How did I get here? How did I get here? And it's Jesus and then you get the greatest thing about following Jesus is you get to sit back and say, look, you're struggling. Let me, let me introduce you to this."
" Worry, let me show you how God pulled me out of this. I go. And I think through this, that does not mean it's going to be easy. Listen, that's stuffs hard, anybody's ever dealt with anxiety or depression, that that usually is more than just a prayer. My friends. Now, sometimes he takes that away in a prayer, but in my experience, when I've set back and I've walked through that with others, here's what I've discovered. There's there's some counsel that takes place"
" There's some life changes that have to take place. There's some mental things that have to change. Jesus has to become part of the platform. He has to be the center of our lives. And all of a sudden you have to begin to do some things to get out of there because here's the deal, Jesus absolutely moves there. But I, and I love this idea of simple obedience,"
" The simple beauty of obedience. I, I kind of talked a little bit about this earlier and I can't help but sit back and go go through here. I was, I was around. I was a teenager one of the times. I walked through a church door."
" You know, it kept me out of church for a long time. I was a teenager and I came in with with a backwards hat, right? Like you kind of can kind of see right? Like backwards hat and baggy clothes. Yeah gentleman didn't say anything else not. Good morning, nothing else. You know what he said? Take that hat off right? And and honestly, you know, I sit back and I look like that. Do you know that transform the way that I had viewed church for many years?"
" Instead of seeing Jesus. As as as this place of freedom and refuge in Hiller a Brokenness, I saw Jesus as an old man that is grumpy."
 And wants this wants teenagers to take hats off. Here's the deal. You know what changed?
" What change is all of a sudden? I met Christ. I met Christ and I realized it wasn't about religion. I realized that following Jesus wasn't about following the whole bunch of rules. I realized it was about a relationship with him. That changes us that the backwards hat kid, really? He could have came in and he could have sat down"
 And he needed to hear that message.
" And in the middle of this, listen, I say all that. Listen, believe learning to believe that Jesus was greater than that gentleman. That was at the front door that morning learning to believe that Jesus is greater than past mistakes past marriages."
 Fill in the blank of whatever that looks like Jesus is greater.
" And then he's bigger than the circumstance that you face. The finally is this and said, we're will close. Check my motives, check my motives. David David says this in one of his songs, he says Lord, see my heart. See if there is any wicked way inside of me. And so when I sit back and I asked us, this whole idea of check my motives God, look in my heart. Look at my"
" Man, revealed to me. If I am living for this world, trying to be fed by a world, that will never feel me our our Jesus, when that's revealed to me. I'm ready to listen. I'm ready to be filled guys. I sit back and and we've been doing this series and you guys can kind of see. There's there's some note cards here. There's some in the back."
" Back is. Well, here's what I here's what we're calling you guys to, because this is going to be really, really cool. You guys got to trust me at the end of our Series. This is all gonna work together. Here's what I'm asking. I'm asking you guys to write down something that you are asking Jesus to feel a righteous a spiritual hunger. Not something from this world, but a spiritual hunger. Think about this things. Like righteousness, you've been blowing"
" Up on your family. You feel like, you know what, maybe you're always full of like, just self- talk about yourself. You don't see yourself as God sees you. Maybe that's what you put down. Maybe it's something like this. Maybe, because you keep blowing up on your family, are you keep doing things that you're not knowing, knowing deep down? That's not what God's calling you to do. Maybe you write down self-control. There's a lot of people that are really sad right now."
" And you don't have joy. Maybe Joyce, what you put down on your card."
" Maybe peace because there's many things that you have a piece is not one that you see. Maybe it's strength because listen, you've been knocked down and you don't know how on Earth you are going to get out of this. God give me strength."
" Maybe it's words, maybe it's a new heart. Maybe it's an attitude adjustment compassion. How about this one kindness? Because Lord knows our world needs that right now."
" As we're moving into this, I want you to write that down, and here's whatever you write down or whatever. You think. I want you to pray over that all week. Long, Jesus, fill me with compassion. Jesus, fill me, fill me with kindness, guys. I love you. I am so grateful for you. I'm looking forward to what God's gonna do in your life this week."
" Week this week. Let's pray. Father, I love you. I just simply ask this if there is somebody here. That doesn't know. You don't allow them to leave this place. Not knowing you, Lord. I'm going to pray, whatever people write down on these papers and us on these note cards if that's at the back of the room or if it's at the front of the rim Lord, I pray over those things. May you fill them with with your heavenly things, not things of this world."
 We love you. Lord your name we pray. Amen.

" Light in the darkness, my God. They make Miracle Worker, promise keeper light in the"
" My God, that is who you are."
" And that is who he is. We're all here with needs to be met and a lot of us are hitting our head against the wall. And we're staying up too late, trying to figure out. How do we meet those needs it? Just as we've heard today, Jesus will meet our needs now. He's not going to meet him as quick as you want him to meet them. He's not necessarily going to meet them. Exactly the way that you would desire them to be met, but he's going to meet your needs. If we just allow him to"
" Like the way and we follow him, he's gonna take care of it. That's our prayer for you this week, that you will let him meet your needs in the ways that he knows how to do it before you leave. I want to share just a few things with you. First of all, next Sunday night is our quarterly if you want to call it that, but it's our next Southern Gospel, sing and I really want you to come next week because that young man on the screen there is name's Jimmy Davis. Jimmy is a close friend of mine. We work together with the Billy Graham Association."
" It's probably the funniest man I've ever met and the man can sing and play guitar and he loves Jesus and he'll be here next week. Next Sunday night at five sharing those talents. Even if that's not your thing, you'll have a good time. Next Sunday night, come and meet Jimmy, listen to him Sharon's heart. It's going to be amazing night. This weekend is our disciple now and this is a lake area disciple. Now we have five churches from Green and Putnam that are coming together Friday and Saturday for our students. If you are students at"
" I haven't signed up yet, you still got time today, so, see Davis get signed up today for D now. Otherwise, pray for D. Now, this weekend, pray that all these teenagers will see that Jesus is the way. And that those needs that they have that, he'll take care of it. So being prayer for them this weekend, if you want to help in some way. See Davis. And he will gladly plug you in somehow. And then finally, today is our next new members class so just in approximately however whenever"
" Sure, I get done speaking. We're going to do our next new members class in here. If you have not signed up, that's quite all right, we got plenty of food. We got plenty, we would love for you to join us today. If you did sign up, we'll see you in just a minute. But against a it's it's no obligation. But it's a great way to learn about how to become part of the Lakeside family and how the, you can plug in and be used. Also, if you've got just a couple minutes, we need five tables set up on this side of the room."
" Five tables with eight chairs around if y'all can help us with that real quick, some of you that'd be greatly appreciated, but more than anything else. Just now that we're praying for you this week that you let Jesus meets your needs that you look to him and look nowhere else. We are so glad that you're here today. We're honored that you came to worship with us whether in person or online and we hope to see you again next week, you're dismissed"
"Well hey everybody. Good morning and welcome to Lincoln County church if we haven't met yet, my name is Andy. I'm on staff and I'm so glad that you're here to be a part of the service today. And I understand that congratulations are in order to the horse that won the Kentucky Derby, the thousand dollars, yearling that yielded a 1.86 million-dollar purse that's pretty extraordinary, right? That's a good investment thousand dollars to one at"
"8, 6 million, I was impressed and do I don't have a million-dollar purse for any of us today. I do have a gift for those of us who are our guests today. So if you're our guests in the room for the first time, I'd love for you to take one of these with you as you go and I'm not going to embarrass you or ask you to stand up or wave at me or anything. But as you leave, if you would stop by the studio, they've got a gift already for you and it's not really anything cheesy. It's actually something kind of cool"
" That I think you'll enjoy using during the course of your week and if you're our guest online, you can go to Guess that Lincoln County DOT church and we'll e-mail you a gift something that I think you'll enjoy using as well but it's a small way that we can say thanks for being a part of our service today. Well as we get into our service, let me give you just a quick overview of what you can expect. Because as we start, we're going to sing two songs together led by Lane Marie oh, Kelly and James David Carter together."
" Our band. And then we're going to hear Aubrey share her story and then we're going to jump into this morning's message into part four of our series. Entitled faithful all about how to fuel our faith in a world, that's largely running on empty. And then after the service is over, if you are newer to our church, that would be one service. One week, one month, one year, something like that. I want to invite you to stick around, right? Where"
" You are to be a part of an event that we call next. And next is simply a conversation that I will hold with those who are here for in that newer category because we can show you a little bit of our story as a church and how that intersects with your story, some of what's going on in your world, your family. And what our church offers Beyond just a Sunday Morning Experience, so I hope that you'll plan to stick around for that and don't worry if you've"
" Kids will continue to watch your kids for that, 15 minutes as well. Well, I think that's everything that you need to know so if you would stand to your feet wave at somebody near you and we'll get this thing started."
" Let's respond to God together. Here we go. When darkness tries to roll over my sorrow,"
 Do I do?
" We sing that song and we're reminded that it's the goodness of God that runs after us because sometimes we tend to think of it as God chasing after us to get us for something, we've done to get us back but instead it's God's love. It's God's goodness that pursues us and that's such an amazing concept but it's one that we can grasp as adults but it's also a concept that"
" Our children and our grandchildren can grasp as well. And yesterday, we turned this whole room into a giant party because there were five children who had decided that they were going to follow Jesus and they wanted to highlight it through baptism. And so we're going to share one of those stories with us today. So take a look at this."
" Hi. My name is Aubrey overson. I'm nine. And then the third grade I made the decision to follow Jesus. When I was at church looking at the devotionals and then I went home with Mom and part about it, I want to be baptized to show. Everybody that I believe Jesus died on the cross. My favorite verse is, John 3:16 because it tells me more about Jesus and it really reaches out to me. I would like to thank my up, Street leaders, Miss Tiffany Miss Ashland."
" And everyone that works at the church. And I want to thank my mom for encouraging me to be baptized. I'm Aubrey and I'm here today to tell you that Jesus is my Lord and my savior,"
" Aubrey. You have such a big heart and you love like Jesus live. And I can't wait to see how that relationship grows and how he uses that and others lives my privilege to baptize you in the name of the father, that loves you. The son that died for you and the Holy Spirit that lives within you."
" It, we get to celebrate as someone says, Hey I want you to know what Jesus has done in my life and I'm going to follow him and that's something that we can decide as adults. It's something that children can decide as well. And Round Here, we say that our goal is to inspire people to follow Jesus, and that happens not only in the big room and online, but it happens down the hallway in our children's."
" Armaments every single Sunday and in our student environments on Sunday nights, as our families are inspired to follow Jesus. And I just want to pause for a second and say, if you give to this church, if you give to fund our mission, thank you for doing that because you are giving towards families that are changing their trajectory because they're following Jesus. And whether you do that using the buckets that are in the back of the room or online through give the lake."
" Cocconi dot church. Thank you, thank you. Thank you for your investment in other people and in their Journey, even as you invest in your own. Well, around here at this point in our service, we jump into this morning's message and we work hard to put the most engaging presenters in front of you and sometimes that means they're live on our stage and sometimes that means they're live from a nearby campus this morning. We're hearing from Andy Stanley."
" Is live on stage at Northpoint today and he's bringing us part 4 of our most recent series entitled faithful and I think you'll be encouraged as we go through that message. But before we get there, as one of your pastors living here in Georgia's Lake Country, I want to take a minute to pray for you."
" Dear heavenly father. Thank you for your love to us. Thank you that you do pursue us that you sent Jesus long before we were ready or even aware. And God thank you that you draw us to yourself. And God I pray that as we go through this morning, I'm just mindful that"
" As the doors open, there's some of us that walked in because we've gone to church for years and for some of us we have a relationship that we point to that began some time ago. And for others of us, we came in the door questioning faith."
" Skeptical, doubtful."
 And God for some of us that's because we've experienced some really tough things in our lives even recently and got over these next few minutes. I pray that you would continue to build all of our faith from wherever we came in the door. God create a spark in all of us that becomes a flame burning within us. That is a vibrant relationship with you.
" And God, I pray that as Hindi speaks to us, that you would use that as a catalyst in our lives. I pray these things in Jesus name. Amen."
" So I want to take a minute, welcome all of our land area churches. It's good to see all our know that you're out there. It's good to be back in all of our buildings but catchers indicator, City Church, we're coming soon, so just hang on. Also Wiregrass down in Dothan, Alabama, y'all are meeting together Redstone, let's see, Anthem church and Gainesville Beachside Community Church in Fort Walton. You guys are back in your building, Golf Community Church and Naples be nice to be in Naples today, but we're not, that's okay. And then"
" Vigo County Church that were, y'all are back in your building. That's cool. Then all three of our Southside churches. You guys are meeting again. Pardon me, for just a minute. I was talking to Chris this week and you guys had like a baptism service. You baptized like, 40 people. That was amazing. I know down south side. So cool. So it's just fun to be able to talk to so many people and worship together, all over the country, literally. So, here's here's something that we've all said in some form at some point. Okay. Here's something."
" We've all said, we all said something like this. I am so glad I am so glad he showed up. I'm so glad he showed up in my life when he did. I'm so glad he showed up in my life. When did if he hadn't shown up and hit my life when he did? I don't know what would have happened. I'm I'm not sure I would have made it through. I'm not sure I would have made it through this without her. I mean she showed up at just the right time or I wouldn't be, I would not be where I am today, apart from them. I would not be where I am today, apart from them. I think these are the kinds of things we say, because for all of us, there have been people who"
" Dropped into our lives at critical times, and we look back. And we think they were such a hinge point. They were kind of, a, sort of a defining moment. They just, they play. Such an important role in her life. We just, you know, who wasn't for him. If it wasn't for her, I'm, if it wasn't for them, that's how I feel about my mentor. Charlie Renfro, who I talk about all the time, Charlie taught me so much about navigating organizational life, kept me off. You know, from going off the rails. Charlie would say, hey Andy what you working on big, what you working on big and I wouldn't working on anything big, but it certainly made me start, you know, to think big my friend Steve."
" I told you about many times, he was my counselor and goodness gracious. There were there were so many times when I just felt like I could predict the future and Steve this is going to happen. This is going to happen and if this doesn't happen, this is going to happen and Steve would he would ask me this terrible question. That would just kind of you know, diffuse me and deflate me. He was a Andy. Do you think God's hands are tied?"
" That's a great question. I be like,"
" Well, yeah, I know, but I still think I know what's going to happen. He would just shake his hand and he really think you can predict the future. I mean, I just feel like God brought him into my life at such a critical time. I'm not even sure I should be doing what I am today without his influence. Then of course Sandra my wife, I'm you're going to think I'm just being sweet and get a nice husband. I'm not exaggerating when I say this and there are people around who would nod and say yes, I'm one of the people who said that after I got married, so many people would say in front of me, without thinking about it, you're just such"
" A better person. In fact, this is what they would say there would say they were here. We are sure. He wouldn't be where he is today apart from her. Absolutely. And for many of us who are married, we feel that way about our husbands, our wives. It's just like, it's like, just they were just the right person at the right time. Most of us, again, have experienced some just in time, just in the nick of time people in our lives. They added something. We needed, they gave us opportunities. We would have had otherwise, they, they brought inside, they brought encouragement."
" Spective hope. Corrections some cases, it was confrontation, and you did not like them then but you're so grateful for them now because your life would be very different, my life would be different if these people had just somehow dropped in to our life. So real quick who comes to mind, anybody come to mind."
" Have you thanked them lately? More on that in just a minute. If you've been tracking along with us, we are in part four of our series. Entitled faithful fueling our faith in a world on empty. And the premise of this entire series is that in the first century when Jesus showed up his agenda, for his first century followers, his agenda for 21st century followers, is that we be people of extraordinary Faith, but faith, not just what we believe that faith in terms of what we do."
" He was a big fan of, and he encouraged to people who followed him to actually do things with their faith and respond to people with faith and to respond to life. As if God really was with them. And that God really was for them. This was the kind of faith that did things and change things, and confronted things, which explains his initial invitation. When he first stepped onto the pages of History, his initial invitation wasn't believed things. His initial invitation was follow me. Follow me. I want you to watch me."
" Live in the real world is if God is real and God is with me. If you want to know what it looks like to live a life of faith, I want you to watch me. And I want you to emulate me, and I want you to imitate me and Jesus never changed his invitation. But eventually the church did the church, reduce the invitation to Christianity to Simply believe in me. And while it's true that Jesus invited his first century followers to believe things about him, that was not his initial invitation, and that was not the impetus of his invitation. His invitation is yes."
" Once you're convinced, I'm whom, I'm who I claim to be. I want you to live in such a way that reflects that kind of big, bold gritty, real world, real world Faith, because believe in me, are simply believe things about me. I mean, that's easy. I mean, that's why the church reduced, it to just believe things, it's easier, it's safer, it doesn't require anything of us that leaves us exactly where we're found, right? It leaves us where we are. There's no change required, but Jesus did not invite people. This is"
" What's so fascinating about the gospels? Jesus didn't just invite people to believe things or even believe true things about him because belief and we know this belief all by itself belief that just stays in our head. It doesn't make any difference. In the real world doesn't make any difference. In our families, doesn't make any difference in our communities. Does it make any difference in our relationship and belief? That just stays right here, I just believe some things about God. I just believe some things about the Bible. I just believe some things about Jesus. It leaves us with frail."
" All vulnerable, feeble faith. In fact, this is why some of you have lost faith. And this is why some of you are losing your faith because as long as it just resided in your head and you never saw it lived out, are you never knew how to live it out and you never saw the results or the benefits or God's Intervention when you live your faith out, of course it's Faith. Just becomes a category, becomes frailing and fragile and eventually it again as we've said, throughout the series, faith is a muscle. You've already got the muscle. But if you don't exercise"
" Sir sighs. It it gets weaker and weaker, and weaker after fees. And so, you may be in a situation where you're slowly losing your faith because you were maybe just raised to believe, a lot of things, and it just stopped there, but Jesus, invites, you and invites us to follow. In other words, were to wake up every day. We've said this throughout the series, we're invited to wake up every day with this question. And I would challenge you maybe to write this down, or do a screenshot or do your own version of this question to wake up every day with this big bold."
" Dating question. What would I do? What would I do today? How would I respond to her today? I know how I normally respond to him or to heard them. But how would I respond today? How would I respond to her? How would I react? What would I attempt? What do I initiate? What I stay away from. What would I avoid? What would I walk right into? If I was absolutely confident that God was with me, that's what it means to walk by faith. It's to live every single day is if what God has said about himself through, Jesus is true."
" And that God is who Jesus revealed God to be, we talked about that and week one. So, in this series, what we're doing is we're asking and answering the question, what facilitates that big, bold active, real world faith that in spite of Faith? They're going to follow Jesus. Anyway, Faith, what are essentially? What are the essential ingredients to that kind of faith when go to that screen? What are the essential essential ingredients? What are the essential ingredients of that? Kind of a, that when stirred together creates an us, this big bold active kind of faith"
" M based on what Jesus taught and based on what Jesus modeled and based on, literally, hundreds of conversations with people who've been following Jesus for a long time. Five things show up every time, people tell their story and so we call sometimes, we call these, the five Faith Catalyst, the five things that God uses to blow up and to grow up our faith. So we've been talking about each of these. So two weeks ago we started with the first one practical teaching. We said that any time somebody tells their faith story, they talk about the first time somebody taught them from the scriptures in"
" Such a way that they knew what to do with what they believed the suddenly became very tactile and very application-oriented, somebody gave them handles and applications for the scripture. And here's why that grows our faith. When our active faith, I'm going to try this at home, I'm going to try this at work, I'm going to try this with my money. I'm going to try this in my relationships. I'm going to try this and how I date. And how I treat women and how I treat men, I'm going to try this when our active Faith, intersects with God's faithfulness on the back."
" And our faith gets bigger. When we experience God coming through for us or just the benefits of following Jesus, our faith gets bigger the last time we talked about the second Faith Catalyst. We call it personal Ministry and we talked about the fact that when people tell their faith story, they always talk about the first time. They decided to do something. They were uncomfortable with something that they did not feel prepared for something. They did. They felt inadequate about but they just sense that internal nudge from God."
" God to serve some other people to step into some other people's lives to intersect with their story and do for them, what needed to be done. Whether it was lead a small group or go on a mission trip or do a service project or just invite someone to an event. But the first time they stepped out and they their faith interface with another person and then on the back, end of that when they saw, what God did in the relationship or they saw what God did in their own heart, their faith got bigger. God came through their faith, grew. So today,"
" We're going to talk about this third thing, that God always uses to grow up in to blow up to make active and very practical our faith and we call it providential relationships. Providential relationships. Whenever someone tells their story, in fact, if you were to stand up and talk about your faith story, even if you feel like you're kind of losing faith that this point, when people tell their faith story, they always talk about people, they say things, you know, I didn't grow up in church, I didn't really believe then, I met this guy, you know, then I met this girl. Then I met this group,"
" Roop. Then these people moved in next door, we found out, they were Christians and we were a little bit worried about that but they were some of the nicest people we ever met then we got to know and next thing you know, we're you know, we're we're we started the believing like they did and we started attending church then you hear the story like well I never was really a religious person and my mom remarried and my new father was a Christian and he made us go to church and I resisted at first but gosh it just it's opened my eyes to a different way of seeing the world. Then somebody invited me to a small group. You know, these girls said hey"
" Once you come to our small group and I was like, what's a small group? They're like, just just show up, or maybe your coach had a coach that was a Christian and he was just there. She was just very different than any other coach you'd had before and they did he or she seemed to really genuinely care, maybe that's your story. But the point is we all when people tell their faith story, they talk about these people that just seem to drop into their lives. It's literally like God dropped them into their lives at just the right time. Again, we probably all of us can think."
" Of somebody that we would consider our put in that category and thus the term, providential, at the time, we don't feel like it's providential. But when we look back and we, when we look at the difference it made, when we look at the way we responded and they responded to us and the way that, you know, when we look at the transition point or the defining moment that relationship ultimately turned out to be, it's like, wow. It's as if God, providentially dropped him into our life, it was like divine intervention. In fact,"
" For you. Don't raise your hand. It might have been an actual intervention. Some people showed up or a person showed up and they got in your face. They put their nose in your business and you are so resistant. And you were so hesitant and you said things, you regret and you had such a bad attitude. But as it turned out what they told you was exactly what you needed to hear. And when you look back on that relationship or that conversation or that intervention, you're like oh thank God, that they had the courage to step in and say the things I needed to hear."
" Even though I didn't necessarily want to hear that and it's possible. I would guess that many of us have played that role in somebody else's life as well, but we didn't know it. We were just being a good friend but they look back on that friendship. And they say, you are the person we were just being a good citizen which is showed up and stopped to help somebody and for the rest of their life, you're a part of their story. You were just being a good boss, but for the person on the other side of that relationship or that encounter for them, it almost feels providential. And when they tell their story,"
" 3, when they tell that story of transition, that story where their life, begin to take a different turn or move them different direction, they mentioned you because it was as if God dropped you into their life. Now defining moments in life, in general, you know, defining moment is that, you know, hinge pointer that, you know, that major turning life. Defining moments are almost, always the most always relational right? Good relationship or a bad relationship. Somebody, you're so glad they came into your life. Somebody you wish had never come into your life but the"
" Moments in life are generally relational in nature so we shouldn't be surprised that God uses relationships to grow our faith. Right? In fact, interestingly enough, this is how Christianity began. Here's how Christianity began, John, who knew Jesus, spent three and a half years with Jesus. And then he's an old man. I, you know, I say this all the time, he's an old man and he's getting his story out. He's trying to figure out. How do I begin this story? That is going to be hard for anybody even believe and he's like, how do I start?"
" This. How do I start this thing because oh, I know. I'll start it in the beginning was the word and the word became flesh and the word dwelt among us. That God hears. This is why relationships are part of a faith that grow our faith. And this is again, this is how Christianity begin God became one of us and intersected with us and in doing. So our faith got bigger. He showed up on planet Earth and he began to call common men and common women to follow him and when they followed, and when they are"
" Eight and their faith intersected with the internet, with the faithfulness of Jesus, in the first century, something happened on the inside of them. This is how it's been happening since day one, that providential relationships are one of the primary ways, God uses the grow our faith. In fact, there's kind of a cool story to talk about this real quick so because not only did Jesus call. You know, intersect with the lives of people. Those people that intersected with other people's lives and turn out to be, providential relationships, Jesus calls Philip to be one of his disciples. One of his Apostles Philip, I want you to follow,"
" Follow me and fill up this kind of cool. Phillip says okay, but I need you. Wait right here for just a minute, you know. Jesus, just hang on and fill up goes and he finds his friend Nathaniel, and then when he finds Nathaniel Nathaniel is a skeptic, I mean, you're a skeptic Nathaniel's, a skeptic and Phillips, like, okay, how am I going to get Nathaniel to believe me. And he says, he just kind of blurted out Nathaniel. We've met this guy and we believe he's the Messiah. He's God's holy one that he sent to, you know, take the next take things forward. And if this is the next iteration of God's plan for"
" Planet Earth and the Daniel looks at Phillip and he's like, no he's not he's not sure. I mean, people have been saying that for hundreds of years and besides didn't you say Jesus of Nazareth? He's from Nazareth, seriously. Nazareth Nazareth. Can anything good come from there? I mean, you could just, as Jesus hometowns, like, okay, not only do I not believe you there's no way the Messiah came from Nazareth. Now at that point Philip should have said, okay, you see in a suit yourself? I'm going to go change the world."
" World, you know, you just stay here and do whatever you're doing. You're not going to get to be in the story. Nobody's gonna know your name. They're Gonna Know My Name. Okay. And yeah, Philip could have just walked off. Philip was, like, no way this guy, my friend needs to meet this man, that I'm sure is the Messiah and I love this Phillips is okay. I can't answer your theological questions. I don't know if the Messiah is supposed to come from Nazareth or not. And no, I don't know any cool people from Nazareth, but Phillip just come and see, come and see, come and see."
" Nathaniel's like all right. And he follows Phillip and he meets Jesus life changes and now he's one of Jesus. Apostles. And he got two rings. He got a ringside seat for the Salvation of the world because Philip just wouldn't give up for the rest of his life. Don't, you know, for the rest of his life Nathaniel's like, you know, every other week Philip, I know I've already said, thank you. I cannot thank you enough. Now, when I read that story reminds me of something that happened to to Sandra and me."
" I want to tell you real quick, then I'm going to look at another passage of scripture many years ago and I promise I'm not making this up. I mean I'm saying it live so you know I'm not making this up. You many meters are many years ago, a couple Tim and Carla left move from the Northeast to Atlanta. Had a neighbor named Jim and Tim and Carly didn't go to church. Anywhere didn't seem to be interested to, Jim was absolutely convinced that Tim and Carla needed faith and needed, Jesus, and needed to go to church. So, he began inviting them to his church, and he does."
" Attend any of our churches to his local church? Not too far from here. And so I reluctantly Tim and Carla were like, okay, we'll go. So they went it was kind of a special event thing from special Sunday, I think so every other two or three weeks or so every two or three weeks they would Jim would invite Tim and Carla to church and they didn't like it. They were just being polite. And finally, Tim told Carla. Okay you go I'm not going and so Carla. Communicated to Jim. Jim thank you for inviting us. It's just not our thing, just not what we do."
" So Jim, you know, like Philip could have been like, okay, did my deal, you know, I invited my lost far from God neighbors the church and they turned me down then persecuted you know, for the faith, I don't know. So Jim do decide. Okay. And so he says the Tim and Carla. Okay. All right, give me one more chance. I'm going to take you to a different church and he brought, well, he tried to bring them here to North Point Community Church. They didn't even go here, but he is so adamant. These folks, they need they need Faith. So I'm Tim's. Like I'm not."
" When we already did that Carlos like, okay, she was a little bit more open so he picks Carla up and brings her to the nine o'clock service here at North Point. Community Church, sister the service on the way. Back home to drop her off, he kind of navigates and explains what just happened. Because what happens here was very different than the kind of church, she grew up in very different and so drops her off, and then he goes to his church through the 11 o'clock service next Sunday, does the same thing next. He did this Heats Brock Harley here to the nine o'clock so that he could get back to his church for the left."
" So many weeks that finally, their two kids said to their dad. Dad, where does mr. Jim in mommy? Go on Sunday morning."
" And Tim's like, well, he's taken her to his different church will eventually to Carla, brings the kids. They love it. In fact, their oldest son, and my son Andrew became, friends are lifelong friends and eventually Tim came and this week when I called Carla to make sure I had the details of the story, right? She said and the risk is her quote, and the rest is history, and they're so grateful to gems. Just I just this just has to have it. It was the in their minds the way they see it, even though Jim just kind of doing his thing."
" It was a providential relationship. It's like God, just brought them and just dropped him right into their lives as neighbors. They had no idea. And the fact that he would bring them here, then, go back to his own church. That's amazing. Well, anyway, I met, Tim on the baseball field, our sons played baseball together, Kim got, they got super involved him join a guest services team. Some of you know, Tim left time goes by that. We joint. They joined our community group and then we got to hear this this, how we heard that amazing story and they just begin to grow in their faith and they just, it was just so,"
" Fun to watch them grow. And then in 2013, Tim was diagnosed with ALS"
" So this this horrible horrible disease and so they were still in our community group. So we decided we would just turn our community group into the Tim and Carla, you know, support group not literally. But hey, we're going to stay with you. They gave Tim three to five years. I was 2013. Tim is still alive today. And so what we witnessed in our community group and Sandro is she if she was here, she would tell you watching Tim and Carla navigate. This horrible horrible disease."
" With such extraordinary faith and joy and confidence in God, I'm telling you it has done as much or more for my adult faith in anything I have ever experienced. So we're, you know, teams him so, you know, several of us from time to time and a lot of us are every year would go to the ALS walk to defeat the walk to defeat ALS. And so on one particular afternoon, I was there and I took this picture on a show. You this picture real quick."
" Okay. Here's the interesting thing about this picture this is not Tim, this is Tim Tim kind of walked in this this particular day and this was a guy in his Committee in his support group who was a little bit older who has since passed away and I watched Tim was saying hi to us and then he saw his friend. He immediately went over dropped to his knee and just took him in his arms and I took that picture."
" And this is what he did. I'm pretty sure I haven't asked, I think he has survived everybody in his ALS support groups because it's going on here, eight. And he has slowly deteriorated as this this disease does to the human body. But I'm telling you watching, in fact, Tim a collar and our community group and Tim has begun, he began to lose his voice and now he can barely talk at all. It's really difficult to understand him and we kind of laugh about that sometimes, but as he began to lose his ability to"
" Speak. He said to me, he said Andy, he said, I would like to lead our community group discussion as much as possible until I can't lead anymore."
" It's just been one of the most inspiring things. So if you ask me anything, you know, who are the, you know, providential relationships, the people that God has used it blow up and grow up your faith, Tim and Carl elif, and their story, big part, big part of our Lives. What God has used to grow our faith. So many stories. So many interesting things. He kept trying to quit the guest services team here, and those of you who are on his guest services team, you would not let him quit. Finally, it was a difficult one to walk. She put"
" Golf cart when it became difficult for him to speak. This is kind of funny. They match them up with a middle school girl. So he did the driving. She did the talking, it's just any way that there, there are more there are more and more and more stories. But anyway, but this is this is just how God does things. Now, when it comes to Providence to relationships, unlike some of the other things that God uses to grow up our faith, you can't create a providential relationship, right? You can't say, I'm going to go create a providential relationship. If you could create it, it wouldn't be."
" The providential right. But here's what we can do and here's what all of us should do, especially if you feel like you're losing faith, even if you feel like you've lost faith, we can, and should be proactive in relationships with people whose Faith informs their decisions, and whose Faith informs their responses. That one of the best things we can do. For our own faith is make sure we are in lockstep. We're doing life with a group of people whose faith in God, informs their decisions and informs their"
" Finances because Watching God, work through them does something to our faith. Now the author of Hebrews Hebrews has a new testament, we call it a new testament book. It was actually a sermon like a long sermon that somebody wrote out, we don't know who wrote the book of Hebrews are the sermon of Hebrews, but it's so fascinating and it was written specifically to a group of judeans and galileans who were beginning to lose or he was concerned this, the author we assume it's a he felt as if this group was beginning to lose a little bit of"
" Their confidence, not in God, but in Jesus, because they were already these Sons and Daughters of Abraham, they were, you know, we would call him Jewish. So their faith is kind of waffling. So he, he part of this letter. He addresses their faith and he's saying, hey, come on, come on, hang in there. And he says he writes this, he says let us the whole, you know, Faith Community. Let us hold, I love this word unswervingly. You know, when you know what it means to Swerve. So unswervingly, straight, let us hold. You know, let us stay spot on, in the hope that we profess."
" He who promised and there's our word is faithful. He's like, wait, wait. You can't Don't Drift Away from your faith. Don't become faithless, just because you can't understand why what's happening in the world is happening just because you can't explain why what's happening to you has happened. You, he says, come on, let's remain faithful. And then he says, and to facilitate your faithfulness and to facilitate are being holding unswervingly to our faith. He says this and let us consider that is, let us think about it. Give this some thought, this is"
" What I want you to do today, he said, I want you to give some thought to how we can spur each other on toward love and Good Deeds. He said so as you're hanging on to your faith, I want you to look around. And I want you to identify the people that you can encourage them in their faith and they can encourage you and your faith. And there may be some people who have really begun to lose interest and I want you to, I want you to have some, maybe challenging conversations and say, come on, let's get back in this thing. Let's don't don't lose sight."
" Your faith, Don't Drift Away and I love that he says and this isn't just cerebral, this isn't just believing a lot of things. This is the kind of faith that shows go back."
" Thank you. This is the kind of faith that shows up in actions and attitudes of Love responses of love and good deeds. In other words, this is active real-world gritty Faith. So give it some thought, give it some thought, not just what we believe, but we do with it. And then he makes a statement that during the year 2020, at least a hundred people sent me this verse because I guess, they thought I didn't know. It was in the New Testament, but this was the verse I got all throughout 2020, ready? Here it is and not giving up meeting together."
" Other people sent me this, verse all throughout some of you sent me this verse throughout 2020s like Andy, we've given up meeting together. I'm like you haven't given up. We haven't abandoned, we just hit pause and besides that this is what I would think that I wouldn't say to anyone. Do you know how many chairs we've purchased over the last 25 years?"
" Yeah, we have so many tears. We're not going to give up meeting together. We have too many chairs, but anyway, so, but anyway, so here's what he says, he says, not not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but encouraging one. Another. This is so interesting. He says you're going to be tempted to lose Faith drift away from Faith. He's like, but don't drift away from your faith because when you're locked in with your faith, you're going to be more active with your faith. You're going to love better. You're gonna do better. You're going to serve other people better."
" And he says, now here's the thing, one of the ways that's going to keep you from losing. Your faith is to refuse to give up meeting together. Not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but encouraging one. Another because from time to time, don't tell anybody, we all have doubts from time to time something happened that just doesn't make any sense of God is a good and loving God. Right from time to time. Something happens that we just we can't make it fit into our world view of God."
" And from time to time, we need somebody to come along and put their arm around us or to pray with us, or to speak to us, or to kind of get in her face and say, hey before you abandoned before you give up, let's let's talk about this. He says, hey, you've got to stay connected. Why this is so big? Because when it comes to our faith, when it comes to our faithfulness to God, and when it comes to recognizing God's faithfulness to us, proximity matters, proximity matters."
" Ship matters because proximity and relationship is a faith Builder. Now, here's something I've observed Through The Years. My observation is that people tend to drift from their Community of Faith. That people tend to drift from their Community of Faith before they drift away from faith. That people have a tendency to drift first from their Community Faith. They move to a different city to had to make a new set of friends, and they met some great people. They just want people to hate."
" There something happened, and they weren't able to attend that Bible study anymore that campus ministry anymore, or they graduated from college and went somewhere else. And suddenly, they found themselves without a Community of Faith, or you began working in your work. Schedule, didn't allow you to connect with your Community of Faith, but people generally drift away from their Community of Faith before they drift away from Faith. People lose people lose faith when they lose contact with people a Fate. In fact this may be your story or this may explain"
" Your story. And again, all of this points back to all of this points back to why relationships are critical to Growing our personal faith. When we see as is the case with Tim and Carlin. As is the case with him and Carla and jump. When we see God's faithfulness and someone else's life, it's easier to trust him with ours, right? When you see God's faithfulness and someone else's life, it's so much easier to trust him."
" With ours, now while most of us, I would probably guess, While most of us have experienced this in some unexpected, you know, out of the blue, kind of way where you guys were to drop somebody into her life or somebody came along at just the right time. This is something that we can and should be intentional about as well, because we have a role to play in this again. We can't create providential relationships, but we can make decisions personally in his family's and corporately that establish, our help us set ourselves up for those kinds of relationships. Staying connected."
" Connected to a community of Faith. Actually grows our faith and we have the option. We have the power over, whether or not, we choose to stay connected to a community of faith in and doing so positions us. This is the cool part positions us to play a role in someone else's Faith Journey as well. Just being in proximity with other believers. You're doing more for them than you'll ever know, just as you're aware at times, that they're doing more for you than they'll ever be aware of. So, when we launched our church 25 years ago,"
" So we these five things were front and center. So we did our best to build our entire church model around these five things specifically around this idea of providential relationships. We knew we couldn't program relationships, but we knew we could organize in such a way that it can increase the possibility or the capacity for people to meet in such a way that those relationships would become providential case in point Community groups. The fact that Tim and Carla were in our community group when he was diagnosed with ALS and to see"
" God has done for them through our group and what God has done in our faith through just their experience again. We didn't you can't create a providential relationships relationship but by building our entire Adult Ministry model around small groups. It creates the capacity for that in the potential for that. And many of you many of you, your part of your faith Journey story would be meeting people in a small group meeting people in a home, you didn't know anybody, you weren't sure you. Even like some of these people and over time because of what happened relationally and then over time, what happened? Because of"
" What happened? Circumstantially. God used these people that started off as strangers as a catalyst for your own personal faith. It's one of the reasons I know last week, I'm several hundred of you said you're going to step in and help us with family ministry. One of the reasons we do family ministry, the way we do with children, middle school and high school students, is this very idea, this is why when children have a group leader that group leader stays with them for several years or all the way through Middle School, all the way through high school, because we've learned the longer people,"
" Are together the more capacity and potential there is for those relationships to become catalytic and faith and providential. In fact, this is one of the best things that we've done. There's been such a huge payoff because the relationship, the relationship between the group leader and kids, the relationship between the group leader and a middle schooler. The relationship between the group leader and a high school student is really more important than the content. That's taught, this is why. If you're a parent, you need to have your kids here."
" Every week possible because the consistency of that relationship in terms of that small group leader, basically, they're going to be a partner with you in your parenting because the relationship becomes catalytic. In the relationship again, has the potential to grow up and blow up their faith and here's the other thing so many times, so many times over the years when I see somebody with a wimble and shirt on or up Street shirt, that's our preschool in our children's age Ministries. If you're joining us for the first time or a Transit t-shirt as middle school or inside out and I'll say to those"
" Leaders fasting about in the community or, you know, all over the place, I'll say thank you for serving. Do you know what I hear at least half the time, no, Andy. Being with these kids has done more for my faith than I've done for. There's, I've heard that so many times, why? Because there's just a mutual thing that happens in terms of fueling. One another's Faith, through these kinds of relationships. So we've done that intentionally that for that very reason and is the other reason"
" reason before we, you know, quit meeting for a while that I was encouraging like crazy and I'm going to continue to encourage you to invite someone to come sit with you. This is the simplest invitation the world. Hey would you come sit with me? I'm just going to not just going to invite you to my church. I quit doing that years ago. Come sit with me. Come sit with me. We did it this week standard, I was on the phone. Hey, hey, we'll if you're you, don't live that far away. Come sit with us and it's like you let us sit with you or like, of course, just come sit with me, a single invitation, some of you are the product of this, as"
" Your story, I should say a single invitation could position you as a catalyst in someone's face story, think about Jim invited invited invited this switch churches. Invited invited divided. It's amazing, right? So, a single invitation, you have no idea. Could be a catalyst to be a significant part of someone's Faith story and invitation it could be an invitation as that would serve as a first step to somebody perhaps rediscovering Faith, after being away from faith for a long, long time, maybe several seasons"
" of life. We again, we never know what hangs in the balance, we never know what hangs in the balance of a simple invitation and the courage to say something. Even though we're scared to death. Now, we tell students all the time in middle school and high school. We say this, we came up with this phrase, that's one of our big ideas for students that your friends determine the direction and quality of your life. We've been teaching that for years, your friends determine the direction in quality of your life, your friends determine the direction and the quality of your life, but what's true for 14 year olds?"
" What's true for 14 year olds is true for 40 year olds as well, right? The people that we choose to do life with the people. We choose to do life with influence the direction of our lives, and the depth, and the endurance of our faith. Again, one last time when we see God's faithfulness. And someone else's life, it is easier to trust him with ours. When we are in connection, when we're in the type of relationship where we are tracking along with what God is doing or what God seems to not be doing what."
" It's happening in someone else's life and they're people of faith when we're tracking along with, we're in that kind of proximity with those kinds of people. Something happens in our faith as well and it's possibly happening through us. And there's so when we trust God with our lives, our faith gets bigger and when we're in proximity with people whose faith is getting bigger because they're trusting God with their live, our faith gets bigger as well. So last thing,"
" If you in this crazy season we've just come through have unplugged from a Community of Faith. If you have become disconnected from a set of friends, that were kind of doing life the way you did life and saw the world. The way you saw, if you've become disconnected during this season, from a Community of Faith, it's time to reconnect. You need to be proactive. Don't just wait for God, to drop someone into your life. He may, or he may not, but you and I have an opportunity, and you, and I have a responsibility to be"
" Proactive in, if, you know, someone who needs to connect, make that call. Why not? Who knows? Who knows that? That simple invitation may turn out to be providential. In other words, when they tell their faith story, they'll talk about you and perhaps when you tell your faith story, you'll end up talking about them,"
" As well, Providence relationships, when we see God's faithfulness and someone else's life, it is much easier to trust him with ours. This is one of the five things that God uses in a big way in a consistent way to grow up and to blow up our faith. And I don't want you to miss it and we will pick it up right there. Next time. As we explore the fourth thing that God uses to build enduring. Faith for you. Go three questions that you should be fun over lunch, or wherever your"
" Discussing these questions and hopefully you've got some folks, you can discuss these with number one. Can you think of someone? This is goes back to where we began. Can you think of someone God, providentially brought into your life at just the right time? And initially, did you resist their input? That's interesting. Number two. You may be hesitant to acknowledge this, but have you played that role in someone else's life? And then, here's the other question. Were you reluctant? Initially? Then there's somebody who's so grateful to you for inviting or asking or serving"
" Or whatever it was. And when you think back, you think I almost missed it because I was reluctant, why? Why the reluctance and number three are the people whose stories shaped and strengthen your faith aware of the role they played in your life. Have you told them"
" And would you maybe this week, short letter, I'm an email, maybe a text may be a phone call and here's the thing, it may have been years ago, they may have forgotten, they may not even know the role they played in your life and here's the thing, you have no idea what that text or that phone call or that email or that conversation you have no idea the role that may play in their faith Journey as well, so don't miss."
 That opportunity.
" So as we think about how to put this into practice, it may be that you reach out to somebody this week, it may be that you cue this up and say, hey I'm going to make it a priority to be a part of a community group like and he's been talking about and I want you to know that those kickoff in August and we'll be talking about, those will be highlighting those. Those are coming. So as you think through your opportunities over the next weeks and months, put that"
" In your plans. So that as we get to August, you still have bandwidth to be a part of one of those conversations. And if you're looking for a little bit of that community, in the meantime, our volunteer teams are a great opportunity to begin those relationships as you continue down that journey. And speaking of summer months, as we get a little further into this one, the month of May May, the last weekend is Memorial Day weekend, and we will not"
" Be having a service during that weekend, that is because we're using that weekend as a big gift to our volunteers, many of whom have served relentlessly since we came back in June after covid, kind of kept us out of the building for a little while. And so it's a gift to our volunteers to take that weekend. At allow them to spend time with their family and friends and so that weekend there won't be any live Services here at our church."
" So, just keep that in mind as you head towards the end of the month. Well, if you are our guest today, please don't leave before you, grab your gift from the studio, on your way, out the door. And in just one minute, I'm going to kick off next from I'm going to be down here right in front of the chairs and I would love for you to stick around. If you are newer to our church and have never sat through those 15 minutes as we talked a little bit about the behind the scenes and answer some of your questions. So stick around"
" And for that we'll continue to watch your children and I want to invite you all to come back next Sunday, as we jump back into this series until then have a great week, we'll see you soon."
 I need you to.
"Well hey everybody. Good morning and welcome to Lake Oconee church both in person and online and I am so excited about today. We've got such an awesome service that you're going to get to participate in. If we haven't met yet, my name is Andy. I'm on staff here and over the next few minutes, we're going to sing a couple of songs together led by James, David Carter."
" Ray Carter and Krista Rooks together with our band and then we're going to hear Mary share her story and I think you'll find it to be very, very encouraging. And we'll jump into part three of our current series. All about how to make our faith run on full while we're living in a world that's kind of stuck on empty. And so many ways is we go through our day to day lives. And as you came in, you got Krispy Kreme Donuts, right? And that pretty awesome."
" You miss that, they're out in the entryway you can still run back out and grab you one. But that's such a cool way to start the day but if you're our guest we have another gift for you as well. I just know how difficult it can be to visit a church for the very first time and just getting up and planning and showing up and not entirely sure what's going to happen. So thank you for being here and being a part of the service and our guest service team has put together a gift to make that thank you feel really real."
" And so you can grab that gift in the studio. As you leave today, the studio is the glass room that you passed on the way in, so just stop by there. Quickly as you head out the door and you can grab that gift. If you're our guest online, you can go to guest dot Lake. Oconee dot church and will email you a gift your direction as well. Just a small way to say thanks for being a part of the service today. Will in just a minute. We're going to start with our first song and I don't know exactly what your week has looked like maybe it's"
" Great week and maybe it's been kind of tough at points. But in this song, There's a phrase that says your lover. Your love is better than I imagined and I don't know if you need to hear this today but you are loved by your heavenly father and the way he loves is even better than you might even imagine. So be watching for that lyric as we get to that in this song and as we get ready for that, stand to your feet. If you would wave at somebody nearby and"
 We'll get this thing started.
" Good morning, everybody."
" You know, someone 39 it starts with O. Lord, you have searched me and known me. He knows us because he made us, and he formed us he's with us. So, for the top of the mountain rejoicing, he is there. If we're in The Valleys, he is. There he is."
 Spoke the god of Heaven.
 Is hard.
 Thank you so much for singing with us today. You may be seated and take a look at Mary story.
" Hi, I'm Mary. And I do not like being in front of the camera, but with the encouragement of the people who love me, I am here to tell you"
" my story. We moved to Greensboro Georgia, in 2015. I'm here with my husband, John, and our son Mason. Before we moved to Lake Oconee. I didn't really consider church as an option. It wasn't good. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't part of my life, back in 2014, we were living in Smallville."
 Driving me some back and forth to school.
" That. We weren't sure that the following year, he would still be able to attend"
 my father suggested.
 Putting an application at like a Coney Academy.
" Just on a whim. And when we got the phone call that we got in,"
" that was still very uncertain time because we had a house in Snellville, didn't have any place to live here and basically had to start new,"
 We took the leap with the help of my parents.
" Mason went to school, not knowing anyone immediately had friends."
" The following week, John came to check out Lake. Oconee Church, thought it was a good fit and brought us back the next week."
" And after meeting Haley, the family ministry director."
 I felt so welcomed.
" And so loved that. I knew that we were in the right place. When I started the family ministry, I was doing check-in and after a, while Hayley encouraged me to Shadow a small group."
" And I got to see these kids excitement when they were learning about Jesus and it just made me feel a little bit more, like maybe I am making a difference."
 They were the ones that encouraged me to come every week.
 I feel like I was changed.
 And now I just can't imagine my life about it.
" Every Sunday I wake up and I look forward to the day ahead. I would like to thank my mom and dad for always being there for me. I would also like to thank my husband, John for tolerating me. And the rough moments, I want to thank Haley for being my friend and encouraging me everyday to do what's hard and I want to thank my son Mason for always being"
" By my side, I want to give a great big shout out to the up Street cones and my up street team that my Sunday is would not be the same without any of you. Thank you for being here for me. My name is Mary and I'm here today to let you know that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior."
" In Mary's video, you got to hear that. I get to play a small part in her story. So this is super personal to me so I'm going to try not to get emotional but something that Mary didn't get to share in her story just because the time and was right about the time that she joined our family, ministry team and started serving on Guest Services. She also joined my small group so I had a front-row seat to see the change that God was doing in our heart."
" In the relationship that she was building and just how that affected their entire family and it was just incredible to see that. So, I knew when I had a small group leader role in F Street open that she'd be the perfect person to sit in there and just love on those kids and teach those kids who Jesus is and that he loves them. A couple of our kids coming up this week being baptized on Saturday and baptism bash are some of her kids that have set through her small group. I can't wait for my"
" little boys to go through her small group and because I know that she will help them create those anchor points of faith, and figure out what faith of their own looks like to them. So it is my incredible privilege to baptize you in the name of the father, that loves you. The Sun that Dad for you in the spirit that lives within you."
" So we couldn't Port you back an hour to when Mary got baptized earlier this morning. So we thought we would Port Mary and Haley out here. Y'all can step this way out onto the stage so you would have a chance to meet Mary. Many of you already know her, but Mary, I am so proud of you for the investment you're making in our children. I remember meeting John when he came to"
" Movie theater that first Sunday and I remember meeting you and Mason shortly after that as he brought you all back and I'm so glad that he did and I've been really cool to watch. You make an investment in the lives of our children. But today I'm so proud of you for letting other people know that you have a faith in Jesus Christ and you highlighted that, by being baptized today. And so I'm super proud of you and I'm so grateful that you did. Yeah, for sure give Mary another round of boss if you would"
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
" Well, I don't know if you caught it in Mary's story, but she said there came a point where she realized that she was making a difference. So God's at work in her heart and she's beginning to follow Jesus. But then she's able to make a difference in the life of someone else who's also learning about Jesus and then begins to follow him as well. And that's what we'll highlight at baptism bash on Saturday which is an elementary baptism celebration for elementary children who"
" Decided to follow Jesus together with their families, their small groups, and their small group leaders. So that will happen in this space, on Saturday as we celebrate that. But Mary now, as, a follower of Jesus has had an impact in these children's life, and she truly is making a difference. And I know that so many of you serve in different capacities and on different teams, and if you haven't heard it lately, you also are making a huge difference in."
" In other people's spiritual journeys of. Thank you. Thank you, thank you for your part in that. And let me also say to those of you who have a plan for how you support your local church, whether you give using the buckets beside the doors, or whether you give online through, give dot Lake, Oconee dot church. Thank you for doing that. Consistently for having a plan in a pattern because you have a part in Mary's story. And you have a part in the story of the people, Mary is influence."
 And countless others beyond that. So thank you. Thank you for investing in our mission of inspiring people to follow Jesus.
" Well, usually, at this point in the service, it's time for our morning message and depending what your background is, maybe there's somebody that you're familiar with that would stand on a stage and present to you. And at our church, we have a variety of presenters sometimes their live on our stage and sometimes they're from a nearby campus and this morning, we're going to hear from Andy Stanley who is live on stage at Northpoint today and he's bringing us part 3 of our series and"
" Old Faithful. But before we get there as your pastor living here in Georgia's Lake Country, I want to take a minute to pray for all of us. So if you would join me. Dear heavenly father. Thank you for your love to us. Thank you for drawing us to yourself as you have done in Mary and John and Mason's life. And God, thank you that you have a plan to use us. So that other people would know who you are as well. And God is we jump into this discussion of how"
" our faith can grow and, and be full God. For some of us we were sputtering along, we have such little faith. A spark would be a step forward and God for others of us, we've had faith for quite a while, but sometimes it waivers and God for all of us, no matter where we came in the door this morning, God, I pray that you would allow us to move one step closer in."
 Understanding of you one step deeper in our grasp of what it means to truly trust you. And God I pray that you would build our faith in some small way because we were a part of the service today. I pray these things in Jesus name. Amen.
" One of the things, one of the things that consistently kind of was sort of off-putting or unbalancing to Jesus, first entry followers, especially his disciples were his disciples, in particular, was his his oversized assumption about their capability and their abilities that Jesus. This is so interesting. Jesus."
" Consistently and again he had a short time frame. So we had to kind of speed things up and so because of his short time frame, he was consistently pushing the 12 apostles in particular into situations that they weren't ready for that they weren't prepared for, and they were really in over their head. And as you read, it's a little bit funny at times, they find themselves kind of flailing around trying to figure stuff out. And in some cases, just flat-out failing, just failing like Jesus says, go do this or he puts them in a situation and they just are like we just, we can't do this and they"
" Fail. And this happens over and over, and over, and to some extent, maybe they, maybe they should have seen this coming. I doubt we would have either because at the very beginning when Jesus began to choose who would become his famous, you know, 12 Apostles, and you're familiar with this story, perhaps when he first called Peter, Andrew James and John, you remember this, he calls Peter and James and John. And he says he says gentlemen I want you to come follow me, Jesus said, and I'm going to send you out to fish."
" For people, which is strange, right? Or are maybe you heard growing up and I'm going to make you Fishers of Men. Now, that's odd. But what's particularly odd about? This was they had just spent all night fishing for fish and had caught what, nothing? Right, they are fishermen. Who couldn't even catch fish? And Jesus says, don't worry about it. Follow me and you're going to catch people, right? And it's like we're having a hard time catching fish. He's like don't"
" Worry about it. We're gonna figure this out then later, even though they were men of the sea know, they grew up around the see, there's a couple of occasions where Jesus puts them in a boat without him, one in particular and pushes them out into the sea, and ask them to basically row across a few miles of the Sea of Galilee, is going to make them on the other side. And even these men who grew up around the sea, they were not even able to row their boat to where Jesus asked them to row their boat. And then at the very end, I mean, this was so intimidating, he gets them together and he smiles and he"
" Catherine is Big Vision cast and he says, very truly. I tell you are. You know? King James is verily, verily. I tell you very truly. I tell you you guys, you guys are going to do the works that I have been doing. You been watching me, do all this amazing stuff. You guys are going to be the various kinds of things I've been doing and you're going to do greater things than these thinking. No, we're not. We couldn't even row row row, our boat for six miles across, the southern end of the Sea of Galilee."
" Galilee we're not going to do greater things than you, but Jesus was constantly pushing it and part of it again. He had a very short timeframe to set them up for what he ultimately wanted them to do. So he would create these artificial points of tension and these artificial environment to try to teach them a very, very important lesson and it wasn't just a lesson for them. It was a lesson for me, tell you a little bit about my lesson and minute, and it was a lesson for anyone who claims to be your wants to be a follower of Jesus. Now, the best example."
" Couple of this is one that we're also familiar with because all the gospel writers, tell this story with a little bit different kind of detail a little bit different emphasis one afternoon you again. You if you grew up around church or Insurance, you've heard the story. Jesus was teaching all day. Now, the bad part about Jesus teaching all day is, unfortunately, the gospel writers. Don't tell us what he was teaching and when you read the teachings of Jesus, they're kind of short. But imagine sitting like an all-day seminar with Jesus, you know, a 15-minute little breaks for coffee and bathroom breaks and get back together all day."
" He's teaching. And it's like, if only somebody had recorded an all-day, teaching session with Jesus, how amazing that would be. But anyway, that they're out there all day, there's thousands of people and they've gathered on this Hillside and the Sun starts to, you know, looks like it's going to start to start setting and there, of course there's no restaurants and there's no, you know, there's there's no facilities and so the apostles that come to Jesus and of course, the apostles are worn out at me sitting out there in the sun too, and they're hungry, but they don't want to say Jesus. Can we take a break? We're hungry. So, they kind of blame it on the"
" This is Jesus Jesus, we need to we need to have a dinner break. Okay, these people, they've been out here all day. They're hungry. Send the crowds away. Send the crowds away, so they can go because they wanted to go to honestly sent the crowds away, so they can go to The Villages and buy themselves some food and Jesus stares at the crowd."
" Turns and smiles at the disciples or his Apostles. And he says, they do not need to go away."
 You give them something to eat.
 To which I'm sure they thought there he goes again.
" And we'll come back to that in just a minute. If you've been tracking along with us, either online or in person, we're in part, 3 of a series entitled faithful. Fueling your faith in a world on empty, we've discovered, and this is so important, and even if you're not a Christian, you're not a Jesus follower or maybe used to be and you gave up because of something crazy that a Christian said to you or bad Church experience. This is so important that when you read the gospels, Jesus agenda, for his first century followers, and his 21st century followers, is that we would not simply be people who believe"
" Things. But we would be people with a very active all in gritty daily relational. You know, in the thick of things faith that basically our faith would not simply be cerebral, it wouldn't be just we believe things about God or believe things about Jesus, but we would have an active, very activated Faith, which explains why Jesus initial invitation, and why his invitation to me and his invitation to you was two words. Follow me, is that I want you to move."
" And I want you to live and I want you to respond and I want you to react in a different direction and Jesus never altered this invitation. Now eventually, the church did eventually the church pulled back from follow me to Simply believe in me. And yes, Jesus invited people to believe in him but he never intended. Any never invited them to stop their believe. In me was basically the threshold to follow me. In fact, he invited"
" Got to follow him and I love this and especially if you're considering Christianity Jesus invited people to follow him before he invited them to believe in him because the follow part was too gritty part. The follow part was the active part and the follow part is what he knew would ultimately build and confirm their belief in him, but believe just believe is easy. It's so much easier than follow right? It's safer. It's less demanding. It doesn't it doesn't require any change at all. You just"
" Make a decision in your head but Jesus didn't invite people to Simply believe true things. He invited people to live a life that reflected this ultimate and awesome and big and bold confidence. In God, our heavenly father, he invited us to live a life that reflects our confidence and our trust in God as father. Because as we said throughout the series trust is the is the currency of a relationship. And so Jesus invited his first century followers and he invites you and he invites me to follow him to live a life that"
" X confidence in our faith in God is it turns out as you read the Old and New Testament that God is. Most honored God is most honored by living not just in our heads or in our hearts by living active here. And now Faith and when are active daily faith, I'm choosing to forgive, I'm choosing to follow up, I'm choosing to step in, I'm choosing to be compassionate, I'm choosing to be generous, I'm choosing to respond, like Jesus are when our active Faith, intersects with God's faithfulness, on the back end."
" Our faith grows but believing without doing believing without doing results in a frail failing flailing, fragile Faith. So people I mean Jesus didn't invite people to Simply believe things. He invited people and he wants us to follow him. He invites us to ask this question and a couple of weeks ago somebody took the screenshot from the message and posted it and said this is the question. They want to wake up to every day and I was so encouraged because this is the"
" Question, we should wake up to every day. We should wake up to the question. If you're a Jesus follower. What would I do? What would I do? What would I, how would I live? How would I respond? How would I react? How would I respond to her? How I respond? How would I respond to them? What would I do? How would I live? And what would I attempt? What would I initiate? What would I avoid? What would I do? If I was absolutely confident that God was actually with me. So, in this series, we're"
" Are asking and hopefully answering the question. I'm over the course of a lifetime. Not just as adults but over the course of a lifetime, what facilitates our, what fuels, the development of active enduring faith, and you've met people like this. In fact, many of you are people like this people who just are confident in God, and they should be in. The seems like they would react this way, but they react that way and you asked him, why? And it's like, well, I'm a Christian, I'm a Jesus follower, they just, they just live a different kind of life and based on what Jesus taught and based, on our"
" Conversations with Excuse Me, based on what Jesus taught and based on our conversation with really hundreds and hundreds of people through the years. We've discovered there, at least five things for five essential ingredients to a growing and during active faith, that there are five things that God uses consistently to blow up and to grow up our faith. So, last week, we looked at the first of the five, we call it practical teaching and we call it practical teaching because whenever somebody tells their faith Story, I mean, if you were to tell your faith story, if you've been a Jesus follower for a while,"
" Whenever people tell their face story they always include. And then I started going to this church and for the first time in my life or then I began attending a Bible study in for the first time in my life or then I was involved in a campus ministry and when I was a university student and for the first time in my life, somebody gave me practical application. Somebody gave me handles, I'd always sort of believed in God, but I never understood how belief in God or belief in Jesus. So it was supposed to interface or actually show up in my day-to-day living."
" So my faith got bigger when for the first time, somebody told me what to do and how to live out my faith, they taught me what to do with what? I believe, they gave me a handles and applications because, and the reason, this grows our faith is when our active faith, not what we're just, you know, thinking about in our head, when our active Faith, intersects with God's faithfulness on the back end, our faith grows. That is when we step out and do what we think God wants us to do with no guarantee of how things are going to turn out."
" And then after we step out and obey, God, whatever that is, and then we experience God's faithfulness on the back end, you know, what happens to your faith grows. It's like a muscle. If you don't exercise it, you have the muscle. But if you don't exercise it, it doesn't get bigger. And are exercised, active Faith, grows our faith. But if you're never in an environment where somebody teaches you and shows you how to live out your faith, it's going to be difficult to exercise that muscle. So, when we experience God's,"
" This on the back end of a decision to trust God, we actually experience God. In fact, some of you there and I'm going to tell you a couple of minute and I'm trying not to get emotional, but they're there for many of us who follow Jesus for a long time. There are moments. There are segments, there are seasons. There are stories in our lives, when we think back. And when we tell those stories, it's always emotional for us because we just never felt that internal nodes. We knew we needed to, we needed to apologize, we needed to write that letter."
" Letter. We needed to volunteer. We need to be more generous. We needed to whatever and we didn't know how it was going to turn out. We didn't have the time. We didn't have the money, you know, we didn't have the emotional bandwidth but we did it anyway. And then on the back end, God just did something. We couldn't anticipate and we never forget those moments in our confidence, in God, gets bigger. So practical teaching, the second thing that grows up and blows up, our faith is related to that and is similar to that. We'd refer to as personal Ministry personal Ministry."
" When anybody tells their faith story and they answer the question, what did you know, what was it along the way that grew up and blew up your faith? People always talk about the first time they stepped out of their comfort zone to serve someone else or some someone else's in a way that they didn't feel prepared for. They didn't feel adequate but they just they just knew they were supposed to do it. They stepped out and they serve somebody in Jesus name because they just felt that internal nodes. They essentially, they tell the"
" We of stepping into someone else's story or stepping into a group of people story. A neighbor may be a non profit and nonprofit that was doing something significant in the world. They had a burden for that and they thought I want to help, but what can I do? And then they got involved in on the back end, they feel like God used them to make a difference stepping into a middle school or a high school group because I remember what I was like, in middle school, and if I'd had somebody do for me, when I feel like God wants me to do for this group and but I'm intimidated and middle schoolers scare me in high school or scare me. But you know what?"
" God, you know, if you can use me, I'm in. And on the back end, you know, relationships were formed relationships with parents. I mean, everybody who's followed Jesus for any amount of time, has felt that that nudge to step into the game and to embrace some sort of personal Ministry. Some of you remember the first time you were challenged to go on what we call a global X trip for if you're from different kind of different churches, a mission trip. And you found yourself signing up for something, then you had to update your passport and had to get a shot. And, you know, it's like,"
" You're thinking to yourself. What, what am I doing? Am I crazy? I mean, I'm not a missionary, you know, and then on the back end because of who you met and because of what you did, something happened on the inside of you. And whenever anybody tells their story, or when you tell your story, here are some of the things that we hear, right? I was so nervous, right? I was, I was in over my head, you know, they gave me this lesson and I sat down with these kids and I thought, I don't even know the Bible all that. Well, myself, I felt inadequate and unqualified"
" But it's part of the story but I knew I knew I didn't know what was going to happen. I didn't know how I was going to turn out. I knew I didn't have enough time. I didn't I didn't have the resources. I there was no guarantee but I just, I don't know. I just knew this is what God was nudging me to do and I wanted to back out and I wondered why why did I sign up for this? And I thought everybody here smarter than me and everybody here knows the answers. What if I say it wrong? But when people tell their story, when you tell your story when I tell my story, what do we say? We say but I just"
 I went ahead anyway and the reason it's part of our story is it because we're great. The reason is part of our story is because on the other side of that decision we experienced God's faithfulness and God's provision and we you know again the emotional part is that God used you and God used me in someone else's life.
" Pushing through pushing through our inadequacy pushing through our inadequacy in order to say yes to God for the benefit of other people. It just grows our faith. It grows in during strong, you know, going to get through the next one as well. Faith, when we push through our inadequacy, I don't have time. I'm scared. I don't have the resources. I'm too old. I'm too young and not educated enough, whatever it is, but I feel like God's nudging me when we push through our inadequacy on the other side of that. That's when we experience God's faithfulness and our faith."
" Gets bigger. In fact, some of you as I'm saying this. You're thinking oh my goodness did somebody send them an email email because you've been wrestling with this. You you've been feeling a nudge to start something or do something, maybe in the community, maybe in the city, maybe in a different city. Maybe a different part of the world may be in your local church, but you'd be kind of feeling that nudge and, you know, you believe it might be from God, but it's going to require something of you and you're resisting. You did, you know, we all resist. That's"
" Not a lack of faith. You know what it is. It's a test of your faith. It's a test of my faith. God, I don't know how it's going to work out. I don't know that I'm adequate, but if this is a view, I'm going to do. What I know how to do. I'm going to trust you to do, what only you can do because that nudge won't cease. It won't desist. And again you have no idea. Here's the other big thing about this, right? You have no idea what hangs in the balance of your decision. If you say yes or no, you have no idea what hangs in the balance in terms of what's going."
" Happen. But here is something I know for sure. Hangs in the balance, the quality and the strength of your faith, the quality, and the strength of your faith. Because saying, yes to God to step in, to serve other people. It's one of the five things. God always uses to grow our faith. You don't believe me. Just ask the disciples. So let me get back to the story. Lord, lord, lord, lord, they're hungry, we're hungry, but don't tell him that Lord sent the crowds away, so they can go to The Villages and buy themselves. Some food Jesus looks at them, says,"
" They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat. Now, little more context for this story because it's I think it's interesting right before this incident, here's what had happened, Herod Antipas, not Herod the Great who kill all the babies in Bethlehem. But his son Herod Antipas was the governor of the northern part of what we would call Modern Israel, or Galilee back then Northern. He was the governor and he was not a fan of John, the Baptist because John the Baptist was not a fan of Herod Antipas because are to hear it."
" Tubers had married. His brother Philips wife herodias. So Herod married, Mary herodias after she divorced herod's brother. Now this was a big No-No. It's kind of odd now but it was like against the law by then against Jewish law. So John, the Baptist who was not afraid to say, whatever came to mind, would talk in the streets about Herod Antipas and how he had married, his brother's wife, so herodias, the wife of Philip who divorced Philip in order to marry Herod Antipas? He she was not a fan of John, the Baptist either. So she talked to her husband and to"
" Arresting, John the Baptist which was a big problem because people in that part of the world thought, John the Baptist was a prophet. They were they knew he was a prophet. We think he might have been a relative of Jesus, we knew their money. We know that their mothers were really good friends so you got this situation and then finally Herod and herodias Herod Antipas. His new wife after divorcing. Phillip are you following this? I know it's easy to I know but we're accustomed to these things that happened back then as well anyway, so herodias her."
" It is talks her daughter her teenage daughter into going in before Herod Antipas, her husband and his buddies, and doing a very, she went in and danced before them. We'll just leave it at that. So, the hair and his buddies, they are also there. So worked up after this very sensual dance, herod's drunk and he says, you know, that was so amazing. I'll get just name something. What name your price. That was so amazing. I'll give you whatever you ask for thinking. She's going to want some cash or a car."
" And she leaves the room and all the guys are like, where'd she go? And she goes to see her mother. And says, okay, what do you want and her Wicked mother. Herodias, says, tell your stepfather. My new husband that I want John, the Baptist head on a meat platter. See, this is why you should read the Bible. Okay, you didn't even know this part was in there, right? I want John the Baptist head on a meat platter. So she goes back in there all just crowds in there all, you know."
" No drunk and she said, he's like, okay, you know, what do you want? And she says, I want John the Baptist head on a meat platter. Now he's stuck because he said this in front of all his buddies, the sure enough. He sends his executioner down to dungeon, the chop John, the Baptist head off and they literally put it on a meat, platter and give it to herodias, because that's what she want us. Now, she's done with John the Baptist. Well, word of all this gets to back to Jesus. I mean, this is, this is terrible, right? I mean either, there's so much grief. Imagine the disciple, let me John, the Baptist was the ladies and gentlemen, Prime for May I, please"
" I present to you, you know, the the Lamb of God, that comes to him and he was the Forerunner of Jesus and now he's dead, and Jesus did nothing to stop it. Now, I know from time to time, we're all disappointed with God, but we just are and you just need to know this was not, that's not new with us and this generation. I mean imagine the disciples. They seen Jesus turned water into wine. I mean that wasn't even important, right? Yes. It's fun but it wasn't important. They'd seen Jesus heal strangers."
" And he did nothing, he didn't lift a finger to help his own second or first cousin, or a friend or Forerunner John the Baptist. This this just made no sense at all. So you should be encouraged, sometimes God's lack of response or not responding to way that we don't want that. We want God to respond, doesn't make any sense to us. Jesus responses in the first century often didn't make sense either back to the story. So when Jesus, when Jesus heard, what had happened to heroin to John the Baptist,"
 He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Okay. This is I just have to say it. Jesus finds out that John. The Baptist has been executed and he goes to the lake.
" It's what he did. He went, in fact, he went as far away from the region that he went to the farthest northern part of Galilee. He went to the lake to a solitary place. He's upset, he's tired, we find out. He's been doing all this ministry. He wanted to be alone, reflect, and recuperate. And a boat was the only way to escape because when there are crowds and there are no Cars, the only way to get away from the crowd, is you getting a boat? This one, the reasons? Jesus spent so much time around the Sea of Galilee is like, guys, I'm tired. Let's get in the boat and go so hearing of this story continues hearing of"
" Us with that Jesus jumped in the boat and head across part of the see the crowds followed him on foot. So they just go around the edge of their, is it still the still inside still inside because they just, they can't get enough of Jesus. And when Jesus landed, he saw the large crowd. They had, they were there waiting on him. I love this. And he was so upset, he had compassion on them."
 And healed their sick.
" and now the story and as evening approached,"
" The disciples came to him and said, this is a remote place and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away. I thought we came for a vacation anyway and send them. This is her sent the crowds away. So they can go to The Villages and buy themselves. Some food sent the crowds away so that they can buy themselves some food. Some, the disciples asked Jesus to do something and then Jesus turns to the disciples and he asked them to do something. Now, you give them."
" You give them something to eat, Jesus. Invites them to be a part of the solution to the problem."
" But what he asked him to do was impossible. There's thousands of people right now, John Matthew, Mark, Luke John. He also tells us this thing story, John said this is kind of cool. John said that Jesus said this to test them. In other words, he knew it was impossible. He knew they were incapable, he knew they did not have what it took to do, what he was asking them to do that, it was a test and John also tells us because looking back, John got all the scoop because he was there for this, when he talked to Jesus afterwards, Jesus told John, look, I knew it. I was going to do the whole"
" It was a test for you guys had a very short period of time. I'm trying to teach you to trust me. I'm trying to teach you to stepped into areas where you're not adequate and trust me to do what only I can do. So when I you said, hey send the people away and so they can get something to eat. I thought, hey, this is a great opportunity, you give them something"
" To eat Andrew one of the apostles who I was named after its admission that Andrew speaks up. He says, well Jesus, there is a kid in the audience here and apparently he overheard our conversation and he is offered us his lunch. But I've looked at his lunch and all we have in his lunch box. All we have here are"
" Five loaves of bread and two, fishes, five loaves of bread and two fishes. Now"
" you haven't been paying attention, pay attention."
" I love what Jesus says next. Five loaves of bread to fishes for thousands of people. I love what Jesus says, next, this you looking, this is how big problems are solved. This is how macro community-wide Citywide Nationwide. Solve problems are addressed."
" And this is an invitation to all of us and Jesus smiles, and he says, bring them here to me. I know it's one kid with one lunch, bring them here to me."
" And there I stand and there you stand with our lobes and our fish, some of you have more Loaves and fish, some of you have more fish than lows and that we don't all have the same resources. We don't all have the same capability, but we all got a little"
" Something. And every single, Jesus follower is invited bring them here."
" To me you you want me to do something. I want you to participate. You want me to do something big, you want me to do something big for the Next Generation? You want me to do something big in the community. You want me to do something big in the nation. You want me to be an event praying for change. I want you to participate. So"
 You bring me.
 What you got?
" Remember sometimes I ask you what, breaks your heart, hey what breaks your heart, we all kind of it breaks our heart, what breaks your heart Jesus says, bring me what you got. Well Ghana know what breaks my heart is. Such a big issue. Just spring me. What you got? Is it the face of the Next Generation? Bring me what you got? Is it your neighbor or your neighborhood? Bring you what you God? Is it University students and bring me what you got. Is it the people at work? Bring you what you got."
" There they stand. There are thousands of people kind of Milling around, since starting to go down."
" There they stand. Staring at each other and Andrew just, you know, alright. Jesus."
" There it is. This should be interesting. But every day with Jesus, if you're one of these guys, interesting, right?"
" So, Jesus directed the people, you know, the story to sit down on the grass and taking the Five Loaves and the two fish, you looked up to heaven. I love this. This is like when he's standing outside of Lazarus tomb, he prays that cool prayer before he raises Lazarus from the dead. Dear heavenly father, you know, it's about to happen but I just want them to know that we're connected. So, okay, here we go. Boom, Lazarus, that's what this is. This prayer is all about Heavenly. Father. You know what's about to happen? I just want everybody here to know this. Not me, it's you through me. So, here we go. And he said, looking up to heaven, he gave. Thanks and he broke the load."
 And then he gave them.
" To the disciples. Now, what"
 and you know what they did?
" They did what they knew, how to do."
" And they trusted that Jesus knew what he was up to sit. They did what they knew how to do. And they trusted the somehow Jesus was going to come through, they literally, we use this phrase out of context all the time, it drives me crazy, we don't, but I hear it all the time out of context. This is literally what they did, they walked by faith. They didn't come up with something for God to do and say God, I'm just going to trust you to know. This was not their idea walking by faith isn't coming up with stuff to do."
 An imposing on God. Walking by faith is when you feel the nudge to do something. You know you can't do and you step into it anyway. They literally walked into the crowd hoping. They weren't gonna look like total fools.
" And the disciples gave him, you know, the story and the disciples gave them, he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people and their active activated Faith intersected with God's faithfulness. And something remarkable happened. They were all, they all ate and they all ate and we're satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets with broken pieces that were left over. Now this, this whole concept is so personal for me and I saw"
" I want it to be personal for you. It's so personal for me when I talked about in this room because twenty five and a half years ago, a group of us felt the nudge to start a different kind of church that we were told wouldn't work in the Southeast because people had tried it, it's not going to work. There's too many churches in the south east as it is. But we wanted to create a church that unchurched people would actually attend and love to attend and bring their friends want to create a church. We got rid of all the stuff that got in the way of people just turning their hearts toward God and we left our jobs and we, you know, we just"
" The problem was we could not do it because the nudge was so strong and every time I see a baptism every time I walk into this every time I drive over and see the building or see what else God has done through us all over the city and different parts of the world. It is so humbling to me and I just I know you look at me and it's like oh but too successful and it's big but once upon a time I'm telling you once upon a time, it was this big"
" just,"
 Bring them here to me.
" ten years ago once and I felt the nudge become, foster parents who"
 I'm like there's no way. I mean I'm too busy either that or it's like he just doesn't go away. It doesn't go away. You got to become foster parents. Like we don't have what it takes. Then we went through the training and we really knew we didn't have what it takes right.
" You know, it was in our lunch box."
" Empty bedrooms, and a little bit of financial margin."
" Spring is here to me and what's happened. Sorry! Those happen in my heart and what's happened to my faith. I'm telling them, they will, and you got big Faith. You're the preacher? No, I'm just a human. Okay? What has, what has happened in our heart, in our life, in our faith? Because we all right, here we go. But this is the way of God. This is why I say this is how the world changes, this is how communities change. And on the other side of it, this is how your faith just gets."
" Bigger. So, I want you to say something with me. And again, if you're a Jesus follower, I make no apology for this. If you're not a Jesus follower, you feel like I'm manipulating you. I apologize. I really don't want to do that, but if you're a Jesus follower, I just want you to repeat this after me. Would you say this with me? Altogether, ready. I'll do what I can do. Come on. Just come on people. I'll do it and second part and trust God to do, what only he can do this. I'll just say that together. Ready, I'll do what I can do and trust God to do."
" Own. That's the Walk of faith and that's the walk that builds your faith. And as long as it's just something you believe you're going to have a little itty-bitty frail muscle. And when you need it, it's not going to be there for you. Now, here's the cool part. I got to finish the story real quick. Do you know what Jesus does after this imagined this moment? Okay? The the apostles are collecting more fish and bread, or more bread than they actually gave out to begin with. I mean, they are laughing. They are giggling. I mean, this is like, what just"
 Happen and I Think Jesus is smiling and the people are eating and they're beginning to think hey we got it going on let's go do this some more and Matthew who was there says I love this. The next word immediately before it goes to their head before they think. Wow look at us and go. Come on. Matthew says immediately immediately. Jesus says let's go.
" They're like yeah, but this is kind of, uh, let's go."
" Take them down to the lake, puts them in a boat, pushes it off and says row row, row the boat. And once again they can't make it to the other side and the text tells us that he asked them to do this. Hoping they would connect the dots between the lesson of the Loaves and the journey across the lake because he had a compressed time frame to teach these men. Trust me."
" Trust me, do what you can do and trust me to do what you can't do. This is the way of the kingdom of God, and this is the way that the world."
" Changed. In fact, that particular Story, the only person that connected the dots was Peter but that's a story for another day and then Imagine This"
" At the very end, Jesus stands on another Hillside. And now, he's just got the apostles in a few extra folks, in, about 20 or 30 women who had supported and followed him From Galilee and Jesus hands off the entire Enterprise to the same group of people."
" He says, okay, I've done all I can do. I've taught you all. I can talk member the loaves. Remember the lake? Remember the lessons. Now, I want you to go and I want you to make disciples of all nations are thinking. Wait, wait! Wait most of us. Haven't traveled any, you know, we've been about 50 miles away from home. You want us to Go, Make Disciples, or Jesus followers of all Nations, that's impossible."
 We got it. We get it.
 I'm just gonna bring you what we got.
" Make Disciples of all Nations. We're Outlaws and fugitives Make Disciples of all Nations, and tell you what Jesus will do what we can do and will trust you and your heavenly father to do it. Only you can do ladies and gentlemen, 2000 years later, here we are."
" This is the place that every Jesus follower finds themselves in at some point and when you hesitate when you say no, when you decide, I'm just going to keep it here and not out there. Your faith atrophies in it, it's weakened. Its frail, and it's not there for you when you need it. And it's not there for somebody else. When they needed that nudge, that that nudge to serve that nudge, the step in that nudge, the step out that notes to invite that nudge to lead whatever it might be. That is your opportunity to experience God in"
" You're just not going to experience from the safety of. Hey, I don't have what it takes. Somebody else is going to have to do that."
" When it comes when it comes. And when you feel drawn and nudged, you don't know what's going to happen on the other side. You'll never know everything that hangs in the balance of your decision to step out or not, step out. But the one thing, you know, for certain hangs in the balance. Is your faith?"
 And the practical application of your faith in the strength of your faith and the endurance.
 Of your faith and perhaps the maturity of somebody else's faith.
" As well, because personal Ministry, here's what does two things. It positions us to experience God's power in our weakness, which is, what God does personal Ministry positions us to experience. God's faithfulness in response to our little itty bitty. I'll give you what I got ax."
" The faith. So if you want endearing, Go the Distance Faith. Don't just believe things. You got to say, yes, to that nudge, you gotta step out before you're ready because you'll never be ready before, you know what's going to happen because you can't know what's going to happen. Other than your faith is going to get"
" Bigger, but we do know is this."
" I'm going to bring you. What I got, is one of the five things that God uses consistently to grow up and blow up our faith. And the folks that said, yes,"
 I'll give you what I got. Those are the people that change the world. And here's the warning.
" The people that say no, we don't know their names."
" But perhaps, you know, somebody who gave into that nudge and it changed your world. In fact, you're here, you're a Believer, you're doing things, you never thought you'd do before because somebody knocked on your door. Invited you to something or ask you to participate in something and they were scared to death. In fact, they told you later on is like, I almost didn't ask you and you're like, I'm so glad you gave in to that nudge because it's so impacted your world. Here's the thing. And I'm done somewhere in the world."
" There's someone who's life his child, whose marriage who's grandchild whose faith."
 Will be changed once you step up.
 And make available to God.
" What's in your lunch box, again? There's a story that is yet to be told and your heavenly father saying"
" Just bring me what you got you, you do what only you can do."
 And I'll do what only I can do and you'll be amazed at what we can do.
 Together.
" You give them, you give them something to eat and we will pick it up right there. Next time in part, 4 of Faith, volume. Now, before you go because of the Season wherein, as a group of churches, there's just one question, okay? And it's the question I want you to answer today. Okay. The question is, are you and hope the answer is? Yes. Are you planning to serve in your local church? The season that simple. Are you planning to serve in your local church the season? I certainly hope so."
" This time at all of our linear churches. I'm gonna invite your lead, Pastor up to tell you how you can take a next step if your answer to that question is, in fact, yes."
" So as we listen to a message like this and especially when there's an ending, with a question that says, are you planning to leverage that opportunity to step into something? Are you planning to do that inside your local church? There's a couple of objections that come to most of our minds in that moment and I would guess that those objections. They probably go something like this, they say on the one hand,"
" I don't have any time. I don't have time to do anything more than I'm already doing. What I have, what I've already committed to, it doesn't fit. I don't see a way through. I'm trying to find a place to rest and it's probably never been more true than as we emerge from covid. If that's proper terminology because there's a group of people who have been able and tried to figure out the best way to volunteer."
" Bring covid and through covid. And as they emerged on the other side, they're saying, you know, I I think I need a little bit of a break. I need to find a moment to rest. And then there are those who have sheltered in place during covid of medical necessity. And, and then, as covid kind of begins in some ways to wrap up, it seems there's a piece of us that says, well, I need a break. I need a break to go on some of the trips that got"
" Nestled. I need to break to spend time with family that I haven't seen. And all of us come back to this moment of saying, I don't have any time and at the same moment we imagine that at some other stage in life, then we'll have more time at that stage. It'll be different will have less on our schedule until we get there and we realize that we have as much on our schedule. Now as we ever have before,"
 War.
" And we all conclude that we don't have enough time. And that's true because the only people who have time, are the people who find time, the people who make time, the people who take time."
" At the same time for others of us are our objection is. I don't really have anything to offer. I'm not sure what I would say to a kindergartener or I don't know how I would run a piece of technology that helps the service happen. I don't know how to handle those things. And these objections that they're real, we don't have time and we may not know how we would make a difference in a particular role or opportunity and that's exactly."
" Are our heavenly father shows up and that's where our faith grows. As we take a step towards what we're being nudged towards. That's when our faith grows, even if we can't see the way clear to the answers to these objections. At the same time, our volunteer and team leaders, they do such an extraordinary job of meeting people where their schedules are and helping them find a spot on a team that suits"
" them while accommodating complex schedules. And at the same time, all of our teams as people step, in to volunteer, we provide materials, we provide training and we provide a Lifeline for every single one of our volunteers. And so, I would encourage you to push past these objections. And here's why. Because if you push past these objections,"
 A couple of things happen.
" If you push past those objections, it can make a massive difference in your faith, but it also can make a massive difference in their faith. The person that you're investing in and sometimes that's 121 or sometimes it's behind the scenes and you'll never get to meet everyone that you impact because you served on the production team or because you were a face in the parking lot that made someone feel comfortable as they drove into the parking."
" King lat, you may not get to meet them personally but it makes a difference in your faith. When you step in to a gap you don't know how you're going to fill and it makes a difference in their faith because you're playing a part that makes an eternal difference. And so after we listen to this talk you often we will challenge us to do a couple of things at the end of a message. Sometimes it's hey, go home and think about this, give some thought to what we talked about."
" Out other times. It's here's some questions. We'd love for you to get together with your small group and process this together. Talk it out together but today, I want to ask you to do something different. I want to ask you to take a simple step, a step to investigate an area that interests you, and here's an example of those areas."
" Take a simple step to investigate whichever of these Sparks your interest. Most, there's the opportunity to serve with kids that are five and under that's babies and toddlers And preschoolers. And there are folks that love to connect with children, who are that age, there's the opportunity to lead children who are in kindergarten through 5th grade, that's the elementary age group, that's where Mary serves. There's the opportunity to serve with students and"
" Arlen High School, the opportunity to be a part of creating the Sunday service each week in production, the opportunity to be a part of guest services and helping me to guess where they're at. Because we know that every Sunday is somewhat he's first Sunday."
" Five different areas, which one of those Sparks, the greatest interest in you because I would ask you to respond to that in one of two ways. In just a minute, we're going to put a QR code on the screen, and you can point your phone's camera at that QR code. And it'll take you to a website where you can very easily express your interest or if you're a pen and paper, kind of person as you walk out today in the entryway, there's some sign-up sheets where you"
" Can put your name and circle, one of those areas. But either way, take that simple step to express your interest and in return will have somebody reach out to you and give you a behind-the-scenes tour of that area, so that you can learn more about it. Learn more about the opportunities in that particular area and I would love for you to know more about our church and the impact that you could make by taking that simple step."
" But here's the thing, as we wrap up today, don't miss your chance to make a lasting Difference by doing something. You'll like alongside people you'll love. So as we wrap up, we're going to put that QR code on the screens right now. And for those of you who are our guests, thank you for being a part of the service today as you leave, don't forget to pick up your gift from the studio. The glass room that you'll pass on your way out."
" For all of us will jump in to part 4 of this series next Sunday and I hope that you have a phenomenal week between now and then, take care."
"Well, hey everybody. Good morning and welcome to Lake. Oconee church both in person and online and since we've been together, last, we've watched the end of the Masters. We've held a successful g day, so maybe that Sparks a little bit of faith that things can kind of get back to normal. But then as, for many of us, we watch the events of this week and they weigh heavy on us. That may even cause some of us to question our"
"Faith. And so I'm excited that we are in a series called faithful all about how to escalate our faith in a world that's running largely on empty. So we'll be talking about that this morning but before we get there, I want to say, welcome to those of you who are our guests. Thank you for being here. I know how difficult it can be to really visit anywhere for the first time, but to visit church for the first time that can be really difficult, and you've got a plan."
" Your schedule, you've got to get up on a Sunday and show up and thank you for being a part of our service and as a way of making that thank you real. Our guest service team has put together a gift. I'd love for you to take with you as you go. So as you leave this morning, you can swing by the studio, which is the glass room that you passed on the way in. And you can grab that gift quickly and take that with you. As you go, it's actually something I think you'll enjoy using during the week. It's not anything cheesy. So you'll definitely want to plan to"
" By and grab that before you leave today and if you're our guest online, you can go to guest dot Lake. Oconee dot church and we will email you a gift. Another something special that I think you'll enjoy using but it's a small way that we can say. Thanks for being a part of our service today. Well as we get into the morning, what we're going to do next is sing a couple of songs together and the words of those songs will be on the screen in front of you. And the words are designed to remind us of who God is and how he"
" Desires for us to see him. So as you stand together, we're going to get started. So wave to somebody near you and then we'll get this thing going."
 I took a breath with your
 To Shadow. You won't light up.
" And I don't always understand, I don't always get to see. I will believe it."
" Sound, will believe you make."
" What an exciting thing to be reminded of. Hey, thanks for singing with us. We'll invite you to grab your seats."
" We sing together and we say that God, would you you move mountains? You knock over huge giants in our lives. And the reality is that God has done that for many of us in many situations, but God often uses us to be that instrument in someone else's life. And that was true of us as a church. Over the course of these last couple of weeks because you may have seen it."
" In the Lakey, Coney News but the Greene County food. Pantry put an article in the news highlighting, what you did on over Easter weekend because together we collected just under two tons of food in that awesome. Yeah."
" Two tons of food. It was given to the Green County food pantry and they are able to use that in the lives of people that have real tangible needs right now. And they are so incredibly grateful for your generosity. But that isn't the only thing that happened over Easter weekend. We had to Easter egg hunts. We had two Outdoor Services and I know that some of you were traveling, some of you were serving in other places. And so I wanted to make sure that"
" You could see what happened here over Easter weekend. So, take a look at this."
" so Easter weekend is a special weekend because we get to be together, we get to invite friends and family, but it really is a special weekend because Easter is the story that goes to the heart of our faith, the idea that Jesus rose again"
" Brings inspiration for our daily lives. So I want to say thank you to those of you who have a pattern of giving intentionally to our mission of inspiring people to follow Jesus because as you give you help make things like what we did together on Easter weekend possible and if that's a mission you haven't stepped into yet, there's an opportunity for you to do that. You can give at any time using the buckets that are beside the doors as you leave."
" Give each Sunday or you can give online through, give dot Lake, Oconee dot church and you can give a one-time gift. You can schedule a recurring gift but all of that is possible through our website. Well, if you're newer to our church you may expect in the next couple of minutes that someone will come out and and present a message for this morning and that happens around here often but we also have really a variety of speakers and sometimes"
" They're live on our stage and sometimes they're live from a nearby campus and this morning, we're going to be hearing from Andy Stanley who's live on stage at North Point in Alpharetta today. And Andy is going to be bringing us into part two of our series entitled faithful. And I think you'll be encouraged as we listen and grow together. But before we get there, as one of your pastors living here in George's Lake Country, I would love to pray for you. So let me take"
" Take a minute to do that. Now,"
" Dear heavenly father, thank you for your love to us. Thank you that in the messiest of our circumstances, that you do move mountains that you do remove the Giants, the obstacles in our lives and God, right. This minute, I think of many men and women who are battling through some, some really big stuff right now and God I pray that"
 In these moments that they would know your presence that they would sense your love that they would know our prayers.
" and at the same time, God, I pray that you would guide them through these circumstances that you would be their comfort their encouragement and their hope"
" and God in these next few minutes is Andy speaks to us, God,"
" We all need to grow in our faith. It's why we came in the door. And for some of us that growth, May simply be a flicker. A spark of Faith, as we investigate, whether whether your real, whether there really is something for us to trust at all. And for others of us, we that Faith step may be beginning to practice something that we've heard and known and seen. And today, we see it in a fresh way."
" God, I pray for all of us. Draw us closer to you grow our faith today because we're here and I pray that you would guide us. As we listen it's in the name of Jesus that we pray all of these things, amen."
" It's believing think about this, if simply believing was enough to make our lives better think how much better our lives would be. What if all you had to do is just believe all the right stuff and then all of a sudden whatever it was, you believe translated into just the at your actual life. If if believing was all that mattered, simply believing was all that mattered, think how much better our lives would be. I mean we all believe in the health of the the science behind Health but imagine if we didn't have to actually eat right? Just knowing or believing the science behind"
" Nutrition automatically translated into Better Health, how much better our lives would be or we know that we believe in the science behind exercise but what if we didn't actually have to exercise we can just we just believed in the science behind exercise and just believing translated into better health. I mean if believing was enough and if believing made our lives better just think how much better our lives would be think how much better we'd be better off financially because we all believe kind of financial principles which to stay out of consumer tat. We should live below. Our income me was you."
" Believe on our means, we should save more. We should spend last we should shop less. What if, what if believing translated into all the value of doing without having to do? What if, what if simply believing? We would be so much happier. None of us would be addicted to anything because we all believe we should be addicted to things. So if a believing was enough, just think how much better our lives would be. If you're in school, you get this because you believed that preparation is the key to doing well in school or"
" Well, in preparation is the key to doing well and everything. But what if simply believing that preparation was the way forward but you didn't actually have to prepare when that be amazing but we know that simply believing is not enough and most of us actually know, most of us actually know everything we need to know to live better and more productive lives, but believing and knowing isn't enough. We know, we should be honest and we know we should forgive and we know we should be faithful and we could go on and on all the things we know about relationships."
" Ships and finances and everything else. But what we also know is that simply believing in simply knowing isn't enough for the most part. We know everything we need to know, and we believe everything we need to believe and believe it or not, and believe it or not. Jesus actually knew this Jesus actually knew this and this is why Jesus didn't simply invite us into believing a lot of things. Jesus actually invited us to do things because Believe It or Not, Jesus,"
 that believing is not enough even though perhaps you were raised to believe that Jesus just wanted us to believe a lot of things and Jesus knew that knowing things isn't all that there is to life either the simply knowing and believing doesn't make much difference and so he didn't invite people to Simply learn a lot of things and believe a lot of things and know a lot of things he invited people to do things because he knew what we know that doing is what actually makes the difference and and perhaps
" You don't get anything else out of today's message. This next statement will kind of launch you in a New Direction. When we believe when we believe, but don't do our dreams, just don't come true. Right? Because believing isn't enough but worse. And what we're going to talk about for the next few minutes is that when we believe but don't do our faith, our faith becomes frail and our faith becomes fragile and our faith becomes people today. We're in part two of a series entitled"
" Fueling your faith in a world on empty. And as we discovered last time, when we launched this series, Jesus had a very specific agenda for his first century, and his 21st century followers, and Jesus agenda, for his first and 21st century followers. Was that we would be men and women and students and seniors characterized by big active gritty in the world, in the community. In relationship faith, that we wouldn't simply believe a lot of things in our head, but that our faith would translate"
" eight into real world action and real-world activity. In fact, as we discovered last time, the only thing in the gospels Matthew Mark, Luke and John. The only time we ever find Jesus amazed, or the only time that Jesus ever marveled. Wouldn't you like to be like one of the few people that made Jesus go what you know, the only time Jesus was amazed that. Anything was the time that someone showed or exhibited, this extraordinary big active gritty in the world. Real faith and this explains. Why?"
" This invitation, at the very beginning of his ministry and throughout his ministry. And I believe his invitation to you. And his invitation to me, was follow me, follow me, because it's relational and it's active, and it's interactive, and Jesus never changed this invitation. He said, I want you to follow me. And as you follow me, you're going to do different things and you're going to say different things and you're going to respond in a different way and you're going to see the world in a different way. And then you're going to interact with the world in a different way, in the people in the world and different way I want."
" You two follow me and he again he never altered this invitation but unfortunately and this may be a little disruptive for a little bit. And that's okay. Unfortunately, the church pretty soon after Jesus left in the church was launched. The church. A few hundred years later actually begin to alter this invitation and they shifted it from follow. Me to Simply believe in me now is you know because unfortunately this is some of our experience believe in."
" Is a lot easier than follow me and believe in me is a lot safer than follow me and believe in me is a lot less demanding and far less disruptive than follow me. Because follow me means you have to do stuff believe in me. Simply means. Well, I just believe in you. This is Believe in Me is an invitation that leaves you. Exactly where you are because you're not doing anything. We're not doing anything, we're not following anybody there is"
" No, actual real world change required, and simply believe in me. But in spite of what you may have heard in spite of, maybe what you learned in Sunday school, when you actually read the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, when you follow Jesus through his his gritty earthy life. We discovered that Jesus did not invite people to merely believe true. Things about him. So they could go to heaven when they died that Jesus actually invited people to live a life in the here. And now that reflected this"
" Big bold confidence and God he invited us to live in the real world, with our families, with our finances, with their friends, and our community, with our responses, with the people who like us, the people who don't, the people who are nothing like us to respond, and to react. As if we really, really believe that God is who God says he is in that God has called us to live the kind of Life, he's called us to live Jesus. Invited people to live a life that reflected their confidence, their trust in and their faith. And God in fact again as we discussed"
" Covered last time that God, our heavenly father is most honored and this shouldn't surprise us that God is most honored by our living active death-defying in spite of faith. And by, in spite of faith, I mean, in spite of the fact that I don't know how this is going to work out. I'm going to do this because this is what God has called me to do and this is what Jesus modeled for me. That what what he was what God is, most honored by is active living in the real world response and reaction faith not simply something that"
" Doorway and our head and you again. The reason we shouldn't be surprised at this is in the same way. We are most honored isn't this true for you? I know it's true for me that we are most honored when our friends are a husband, or wife or fiance or someone that we care about when they express that kind of confidence in us, we're supposed to be somewhere at 7:00. It's 7:15, we're still not there and your fiance your boyfriend, your husband, your wife, your best friend says, don't worry about it. I'm sure they have a good reason. I'm not worried why? Well, I just know who they are. They're going to"
" To come through. I mean, aren't we, most honored when you find out, somebody says something bad about you and a friend stuck up for you and said, nope, I don't believe that's true. That's not the person I know. Did she I've never heard her saying, I've never seen her act that way. I've never seen him act that way, I don't believe that's true of him. I think I know them so. Well, I don't believe that what you're saying is true. If you ever hear a story like that, aren't you? Extraordinarily honored when people fill in the gap between what they equip people expect and what they experience with you and they can either believe the best or believe the worst and somebody"
" Chooses to trust you and believe the best. I mean, is there anything more honoring? Well, in the same way as we make our way through the New Testament, as we discover who God, is because of what Jesus taught, our heavenly father is most honored. Our heavenly father is most honored when we live as if he is who he says he is and his Express himself through Jesus and respond in the real world with confidence that God is who God claims to be. That is how God is most honored, which means simply believing"
" Alone doesn't really make any difference. Again, as I said earlier. Believing alone, simply believing creates a real fragile, and frail. Feeble kind of faith. In fact, you probably aware of this James, the brother of Jesus who knew what Jesus taught, even though he wasn't sure. He believed who Jesus claimed to be later. James, the brother of Jesus shows up as the leader of the church in Jerusalem believes, his brother, was his Lord and James writes a letter. We called the Book of James and New Testament. And he says, what"
" The says, but he says this and we're going to come back to this in a minute. He said, if you have faith that doesn't do anything, if you have faith in your mind or your head, and it doesn't show up in the real world, it's dead and then he uses this word. He says it's useless. It doesn't do any good faith. That doesn't do any good, isn't any good? Now, the reason this is important. For some of you in particular, this may explain why you lost your faith."
 Or it may explain why you feel like you're losing. Your faith will come back to this in a minute as well. That faith is like a muscle if you don't use it. You what you
" That's right, you lose it. If you don't use it you lose it and faith is the same way. And when we don't exercise our faith in the real world, with our time, with the people around us, with our money, with our family, with the things that are required of us. When we don't exercise our faith, our faith begins to wither away. So consequently if you're a person that was raised in some kind of religious system where you were taught and I understand this, because of some things that we find in the New Testament you were taught. Well this is just about believing"
" Leave all the right stuff but you never learned or you were never challenged to live out your faith in the real world. Nobody ever gave you handles and applications then it's possible that you believe correctly, but your belief has never been translated into action. And consequently you have a weak and feeble faith, and it could be because of circumstances. You're beginning to lose it or perhaps you've lost it but active and activated Faith. Actually fuels more faith, just like X."
" Sizing a muscle strengthens the muscle, but in active Faith doesn't do anything. Active Faith changes us changes things. So again, Jesus didn't invite us to Simply believe a lot of things. He didn't he didn't simply invite us, you know, to believe different ways that of how the world works. Even though he certainly corrected everybody's world view but then he would correct their worldview and say in light of that. Here's what I want you to do. He invited us to follow him, he essentially,"
" He invited us and I guess this is a good way to summarize it. He invited us to wake up every morning and I try to do this to wake up every morning and ask this question, what would I do now? What would I think or believe? But what would I do if I was absolutely confident that God is with me and that God is who God claims to be as revealed through Jesus. If Jesus was right about God, we talked about that last time and God is with me. What would I do today? How would I"
" Spawned. What would my attitude be when this happens when I walk into that meeting and they're going to say what they always say, it make me feel the way I always feel. How would I react? What, what would I attempt to do? If I was confident, God was with me? What would I avoid? What would I initiate? So, in this series what we're asking, is this, we're asking the question that over the course of a lifetime over the course of a lifetime, what fuels, or what facilitates, this kind of enduring, active Faith, so that"
" Over the course of a lifetime. Not only do we maintain our faith, but we maintain a faith that actually makes a difference in the world. What can we do to ensure that our faith doesn't atrophy? That our faith doesn't dissipate that our faith is that knocked down once and for all by some set of circumstances, how do you build? Go the Distance Faith? Because as we said, we've all met people like that. And when you meet someone like that, especially when they're going through the valley of the shadow of death and they just have this remarkable confidence in God, you find yourself thinking"
" I want to have that, and if I'm ever facing those circumstances, I want to have that kind of confidence. Well, the question is, how do you get that kind of faith faith that, you know, is resilient in childhood through adolescence, through the university life, marriage, remarriage, whatever it might be. What creates that kind of in spite of going to follow Jesus. Anyway, kind of Faith. Or another way of asking it is, what are the ingredients? I mean, if somebody would just tell me what the ingredients are, I could put them together and mix them up and have that kind of enduring faith in God."
" God, I would do that. So here's what we've said, that based on what Jesus taught and based on what Jesus modeled throughout the gospels and based on hundreds of interviews that we have done formally and informally with Go the Distance, Christians we're convinced there are five specific things that God uses to grow enduring Faith. Now there may be seven, there may be 10 but we know we feel confident. There are at least five based on the stories of people who told us their faith story."
" When they tell their faith story, these five things show up over and over and over again. And the thing that's amazing is these five things are relevant and interface with us in every season of life. And I've been personally through almost every season of life, I can tell you these five things, you don't outgrow them. They're not a list, it's not five things that you do. It's not five things. You're going to find listed in the Bible that these five Dynamics are. True of anyone who has enduring"
" And Faith. So sometimes we refer to these, you may have heard us, talk about the five Faith, Catalyst, or sometimes refer to these, the five cases, based Catalyst, five things God uses to grow up and blow up our faith. And again, they intersect with our lives in every season of life. That's what makes them. So Dynamic. So, for the next few weeks, we're going to explore each one of these. And today, we're going to jump into this first Faith Catalyst, and we refer to it as practical teaching, practical teaching, whenever you hear someone telling."
" Faith story. In fact, for many of you, if you were to sit down and just say, here's my faith story, you would tell me about a time where people talk about a time, they were first introduced to a church, or a Bible study, or a small group, maybe in a university setting or maybe. Once they move to a different city, everybody always tells the story of the first time. Someone opened up the Bible and taught it in a way that they knew what to do with, what they've always believed that for the first time, somebody gave them"
" Um, handles, for the first time somebody gave them application. They certainly weren't simply learning new things. They walked out and they knew what to do with what they've learned. And so for people who have enduring Faith, as some point along, the way they were introduced to Hands-On practical Christian Living, they knew what to do with this in their marriage, and with their finances, and with their kids, and in the community. And when they faced Temptation, and when they were going through a difficult time, and when they were worried, and when they were overcome with fear,"
" They knew what to do with what they believe in. The reason the reason that application or acting on what we believe grows our faith. The reason this makes our faith bigger is this. And most of us have experienced this somewhere along the way that when are active are activated faith. In other words, when we're actually doing this stuff when our active Faith, intersects with God's faithfulness, on the other side, what happens, our faith gets bigger. And other words,"
" When you step out and actually do what Jesus has called us to do and we're going to talk about some of those things in a minute. And you do them thinking, I don't know if this is going to work, I don't know if there's going to be any return. I don't know how this is going to turn out, but you know what? If Jesus Is My Lord, this is what I'm supposed to do when we step out and actually do the things that God has called us to do. And then on the other side of that decision, we experience the faithfulness of God. You know, what happens, our faith or our confidence in God."
 Bigger and get stronger.
" Now, there are so many illustrations of this. And again, many of you can stand up this minute and talk about the first time you did something where you thought. Okay, this is crazy. This isn't the way I was raised, you know, I don't know how this is going to work, but I really feel like this is something God wants me to do. And you just said, okay, here we go. And you felt a little bit like it was a free fall and then on the other side, you experience God's faithfulness and what happened your faith, it got bigger, but until you took that step until you apply that,"
" Rinsable until you went home and begin talking and different terms with your husband, or your wife until you rearrange your finances, until you decided. You know what, I'm going to lead with kindness instead of you know you know, normally I lead with when the first time you did that and experience God's faithfulness on the other side, what happened to your faith, it grows, but it doesn't grow until you activate. Remember, we said this last time that trust remember, this trust is the currency of relationship and when we obey"
" May God who this? That still Small Voice, that nudge go over there and talk to her. Go there and confront him, you know, go over there and apologize, go ask for forgiveness, whatever. The nudge is be more, compassionate be more generous when when we're obedient and trust God, it provides god with an opportunity to be trustworthy back and to demonstrate his faithfulness to us. And again, open the gospels read, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, this was a theme in terms of how Jesus led and it was a theme in terms of"
" Jesus taught as we're going to see last week and to me these stories are so funny because throughout Jesus, you know, Ministry on Earth with his first century followers especially his Apostles, he was constantly pushing them out to do things. They knew they were incapable of, we're going to look at one next week, just he would just put them in these kind of no-win situations know when circumstances and his goal was he had a very short, you know, amount of time to say, look I need you to learn to trust me. So I'm going to ask you to do."
" Do things that are unusual. Then you're going to experience my faithfulness on the other side and on the other side, your confidence, it means going to grow its again you're exercising that muscle, but the area and his teaching where this was most pronounced is actually in was considered his most famous sermon. We call it, the Sermon on the Mount. I'm convinced that the content, The Sermon on the Mount, you find it in Matthew and a portion of it in the Gospel of Luke. I think this was Jesus, go to message that often times in the gospels that says and then,"
" At the people down and began to teach. And it doesn't tell us what he taught multiple times. Jesus was teaching or they would walk up and find Jesus, teaching or Jesus was teaching in the temple and we're like, What did he teach? I think this is his go-to message because this was the kingdom ethic and The Sermon on the Mount. Jesus unveils this very much others. First upside down kingdom ethic that stood, in sharp contrast to everything in the Roman Empire, for sure everything in Pagan religion, for sure. And it stood in sharp contrast to the"
" The first century version of Judaism, which had got had drifted in quite a ways from the original intent. So, Jesus is introducing this top, this upside down kingdom ethic were the people with all the power in the resources are supposed to leverage, their power, and resources for the people with fewer power, less power, and fewer resources. I mean, people are like, what, you know, if you're in, if you're going to follow me, you're going to serve other people. You're going to leverage what you have and the opportunities you have for the sake of other people's, like what it was. So upside down,"
" Turn the other cheek like really. If someone at he said, if somebody asks for a favor do more than they ask for, he talked about generosity and he didn't give us a limit or percentage, he just open handed generosity. He forgive regardless just regardless forgive, regardless, pray for your enemy yank, the plant, you know, the ankle playing teaching like you looking at somebody, and there's something about them, that bothers you and you think you're going to confront him and Jesus said, I got an idea before you kind of get up in their business, you need to go home, look in the mirror and see if there's any of that in you."
" And take the plank out of your own eye. And then you're going to see more clearly to help get the little speck of dust out of their eye because you do need to confront them and you do need to challenge them and it may not go well, but because you love them, you are going to have that conversation, but before you look to try to get the little speck out of there, I, you got to get the plank out of your own. So there was all this kind of others firstness. He told a group of people who had so much to worry about, don't worry. And then he said, oh yeah, the other part of this is, by the way, you can't be"
" Right with God, if you're not right with your brother and your sister, I mean, everything in The Sermon on the Mount was. So upside down, it was so different. It was so challenging and it was so practical. These were go out there and do this stuff and this was his way of saying if you're going to follow me. And by the way, God sent me to reveal himself to you through me. So following me is a step in following God, if you're going to follow me, this is what I want. You"
" To do. And it was terribly practical. It was so practical, it felt impractical. So, no wonder many years later. The church kind of backpedals and says, let's just, let's just focus on believe all the right stuff. Let's just focus on Theology. And, you know, our theology is better than their theology. So, aren't yours is going to be different than their Church in our chairs. We believe We Believe lead, they believe, but we believe suddenly becomes all about belief but read the"
" I suppose Jesus is like now believing without doing is pointless. If your faith doesn't do any good it's not any good. Jesus did not leave us with the option of Simply believing all the right stuff. So, anyway, he gets to the end of this, this very, very practical disturbing sermon and at the very end he gives us a promise. Now this passage I'm going to read to you for many of us. It's so familiar. There's actually a"
" Song, but don't don't start singing the song, okay? And, and try not to rush to the end. If you already know this pair of well, basically it's a parable. So at the end of this practical, practical, practical message that Disturbed, all their norms and just turned everything upside down for these people who considered themselves already, very religious, people who already believed all the right staff. He said this. He said everyone everyone who hears these words of mine talking about The Sermon on the Mount and all"
 His teaching everyone who hears these words of mine and believes them. No remembers them. Nope. Agrees with them. Nope. Feels convicted by them.
 Nope.
" And that's about as far as we take most sermons and most teaching, isn't it felt terrible for, you know, unfortunately, many of us have confused, a religious experience with feeling bad about ourselves, depending on what kind of church you grew up in. It's like the worst. I feel about myself at the end of the message, the more closer I feel to God because I think God just wants me to feel bad about myself, and I really felt bad about myself after that sermon and you feel like you've had an encounter with God, but you don't go change anything, right? And Jesus says, okay, we're done with all that."
 One who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice anyone. Hears these words of mine and acts on what I've taught is like a wise man.
" Why is, man, we talk about this all the time. A wise person is someone who connects the dots. A wise person. Is someone who connects the dots between behaviors and outcomes, who understands that. If you don't behave differently, there's not going to be a different outcome. Who lives is a wise person lives. As if today's behavior is going to shape and show up in tomorrow's reality, they understand that knowing. But not doing doesn't make any difference. He said, anyone who"
" Just heard what I said and practices, it not one time but Embraces this as a lifestyle is like a wise man or wise person who built his house or established his life, or established her future or went all in on the Rock. Now in our world, if you buy a piece of property that's Rocky that is not a good thing and if you buy a piece of property that has a lot of rock just below the"
" The, the surface of the, you know, the the topsoil, it's really a bad thing, you have to have Dynamite, right? But in this day because we know how to pour concrete and creates footings, but in this day and age, if you wanted to build a house that was going to last and had a foundation that was going to support it, you actually tried to build on Rock but the problem was building on Rock was very very labor-intensive. It was very expensive and I think most to the point Jesus is making it was very time-consuming. So if your"
" Friend, a mile away, found a place where there was no Rock, their house was up in no time. Meantime, you're still trying to get the foundation doug because you're building on Rock. But here's this point, the wisest thing you could do. He's saying the wisest thing I could do. You say the most future-oriented thing that we could do is to build our lives or build our futures on what he was teaching. He's saying, I want you to live as I've instructed you to live. And if you live as I've instructed, you not just"
" Believe, as I've instructed you to believe, if you live, as I've instructed you to live, it's like building your house on a foundation that's going to serve you for a long long time. It'll cost you"
" But it will be rewarding, and the long run now."
" When Jesus said this, it left a question hanging over the audience and it's a question that hangs over us if we really understand what he's saying. And the question that hangs over the audience that hangs over us, especially you go home this afternoon or whatever you're watching this. If you open to Matthew or Luke and read The Sermon on the Mount and you're like, whoa, I don't even that's a lot. The question that hangs over this. This challenge is, do we trust him?"
" Do we trust him? Are we willing to embrace his teaching as a lifestyle before we know the outcome? Are we willing to do what he's asked us to do? In other words, are we willing to follow before we know exactly how it turns out and our families with our finances, with our friends at our communities and our heart in our lives? That was the issue. Am I going to listen? Believe respect, Say Amen."
 An odd but not do because it seems too risky or am I willing to trust him and follow? That is
" The issue and then Jesus didn't stop there. He talks about what happens for those who choose to do, what he's asked him to, do he illustrates the outcome or the future of the wise people he says and then the rains came down. You remember this part? The rain came down, the streams Rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house but it did not fall."
 Because it had its foundation.
" On the Rock, something they completely understood flash floods weren't all that common with. But when there is a flash flood in that region of the world, it was devastating and the foundation of a house. Determine if it was a partial loss or a total loss, the foundation of a house would determine whether there was a loss of life or the family escaped with minor injuries or perhaps no injuries at all."
" and then he turns the corner, but"
" Everyone who hears these words of mine, this is so important. For those of us who consider ourselves church people. And if you're not a church people, you're going to love this if everyone but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice. So we agreed. We said, amen. We're like this is amazing. I've never heard anything like this. It's like, that's a anyone who's these words of mine and does not put them into practice? Does it? Not doesn't believe them but doesn't do anything with it. It's like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. Now the implication, the"
" Jesus is saying here, for those of us who are church, people is stunning for the average her church person. Here's why I say this because what Jesus is saying here is it is possible to hear and believe and Nod and if you grew up in a church like mind, I grew up in and say, Amen, right? It is possible to hear and believe and Nod and agree and live a life that sets you up for a"
 Isis.
 Faith.
" It is possible to believe to hear and believe and yet live a life that actually sets you up to lose your faith and lose your confidence of God. And again for somebody to here today, this is your store, you grew up believing all the right things and you've lost your faith in Jesus is, I understand why? Because believing isn't that thing, it's following. That's the thing believing doesn't build. Your faith is following that builds enduring faith. Believing in other words,"
" Can be deceiving now, if you're not a Christian or used to be, and you've kind of given up on faith, this is, this is, this is, I can so appreciate your dilemma because it could be that your issue with me and your issue with Christians and your issues with Christianity. Isn't that you don't believe what we believe your issue is more fundamental."
" Your issue is you don't believe that. We believe what we say we believe because we don't do it and that's reason enough to walk away from or to say no to Christianity. I get that and I'm sorry. And if that's the reason you left that's on us, that is not on you. Because what else would you do? When you hear what we say? And you hear what we preach and you hear what? We teach"
" And then you look at how we live. And Jesus says, it's possible to hear and believe and not do and to undermine your own."
" Faith James again, the brother of Jesus coming in after, you know, Jesus, resurrection, he's even more direct. Here's what James wrote in his letter, you've heard this he says come on, don't merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves there it is. Believing can be deceiving, don't you? Dare sit and listen to go. Aha, yeah. I agree. And so deceive yourself, you can listen and believe and argue Theology and argue. Why your version of Christianity is better than their version of Christianity all day long and be completely deceived."
" If you don't do what it says and then James gives that great mirror illustrations. One of my favorite things in the New Testament that mirror illustration he says believing and not doing is like getting up in the morning and walking into your bathroom and you look in the mirror and you go, oh, I believe something needs to be done about that face."
" And I believe something needs to be done about that hair, and then you put on your bathrobe and you go to work. He said, who would do that? We're like, nobody would do that because once I see it and once I believe something needs to be done about it, when it comes to my looks, and my face, and my hair, and your face and your hair, we do something about it. He says the person that sits and listens and believe it doesn't do anything is just as foolish as the person who says wow, what a mess. I am."
" And does nothing about it and you would never do that. And yet, for some of us church people,"
" We do it all the time. And consequently, our faith is weak. Our beliefs may be correct. This is why this is such a stunning Parable but our faith."
" Is weak and then James. Like, Jesus adds a promise. James promise is this, but whoever looks intently into the perfect law. Wish we could talk more about that. The perfect law that gives Freedom, if your version of Faith doesn't give you Freedom. You've got the wrong version or you're not living out your version. Whoever looks into the perfect law and to give us freedom and continues in at not forgetting what they have heard. But doing it, they will be blessed in what they do. Listeners and hearers are not blessed in there, listening in their hearing, James says there is an outcome."
" There is a benefit and following Jesus, but you will never experience the benefit which a consequently will grow your faith. If you don't act on it, if you don't do it again, Jesus version of the same promise, and the rain came, and the streams Rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house. Yet, it did not fall because his foundation was on the Rock believing,"
 Can be deceiving.
" back to the other guy but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand, it was quick and easy got that house up in no time listened maybe even believed"
 Didn't do anything with it because it's too hard. It's too demanding. And the rain came down the streams Rose
" Then the streams Rose and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell."
 The great crash. This is very important.
 Do you know how people?
" Who listen and believe. But don't do, do you know how people who listen and believe, but don't do respond."
 When the crash comes and their house falls down.
 They either blame God or they decide there is no God.
" Because even though they believed because although they believed their faith was feeble, frail and fragile. If you don't exercise it in the real world, if it's nothing, but a system of belief, it will not support you and it will not come through for you when things get difficult."
 This is the coolest part of the story. Maybe when Jesus had finished this at the very end when Jesus finished teaching all this and saying these things the crowds were amazed they're amazed they were amazed at Jesus. They were amazed at his teaching because he taught as one who had Authority and not as their teachers.
 Of the law. Here's this point. Here's our point.
" When your obedience that is my say obedience, I mean, when you're living out your faith, when you're generous was hard to be generous, you're compassionate and your anger, instead of being angry. When you step up when you confront, when it be easier to be quiet when you're quiet, when it be easier to confront. When you, when you kind of give in to that still Small Voice and you know what you ought to do, but you just don't want to do it with when you are obedient to God and your faithfulness, intersects with his faithfulness, when your"
" Faith, your Act of Faith, intersects with his faithfulness, your faith gets bigger, and it gets stronger, because again, it's like a muscle. But if you if you neglect it, if you refuse to act on what you claim to believe, one day, you may wake up and realize you don't believe at all. And initially, you may be relieved to get done with this, gives to his throw off, all this Christianity stuff. You may be relieved initially life might even feel easier for a while."
" But here's what we know about life, right?"
 When the rain comes.
" And it's coming and the streams rise to going to rise. And when the wind blows and beats against that house, that was built on Sand. There's going to be a collapse."
" And because your heavenly father loves you and because Jesus is your savior and came to reveal what God is like he's saying. Come on, come on, I want to show you a better way, not just a better way of believing. I want to show you a better way of living, so I want you to follow me now. Here's what, here's what I know and I'll wrap this up when you meet someone with big faith. I mean, big bold and daring. I don't mean bowl, like their personalities, but I mean, they're just, there's just this confident. It's like this Rock Solid confidence like,"
" They're their faith isn't built on just a belief system. It's like, it's even if there's more Foundation to it than that when you meet somebody that kind of Faith, they've been living it, not just listening to it. And I feel so blessed because I grew up in a church that were my dad was the pastor, and he just gave us handles application with money with relationships with marriage with our emotions. I mean, he constantly look for ways to live, we would leave church knowing what to do with what we've heard, a gentleman named."
" To Han would do our camps when I was in high school and then later to college, even after college taught, this huge Bible study and this in our city. And it was so practical we left there knowing what to do with what we had heard. And this is why in all of our churches. We provide handles and all of our environments. We provide handles for your children from your students and middle schoolers. We don't want people to just believe, right? We want people that live, right? But sometimes you don't know what to do with. What you heard. What? You believe until somebody gives it to you. This is why one of the things that grows your faith and grows our faith."
" Is being exposed to practical application oriented teaching. And I know, for some people, some of your relatives won't visit any of our churches with you. And perhaps there's things about our church that disturbs you, because you feel like, cheers needs to be quiet and reverent, and holy and an experience with God and reflection. And I get that there's a place for reflection, and there's a place for quiet, but this isn't it. And here's why and I'm not comparing myself to Jesus. So I want to have a disclaimer. Before I say what I'm about, to say, when,"
" Jesus taught. And when Jesus would preach, it was not quiet on a couple occasions. John says, they picked up stones to Stone him before he finished the sermon. It was not a quiet reflective environment arguments broke out riots broke out one time. They tried to push him off a cliff while he's teaching. Okay, that's why we have so much space between the front of the stage and, you know, the first row in our Auditorium is, right? It was disruptive it was challenging."
" It was emotional people would leave angry sometimes, I would leave, you know, joyful but sometimes it was just, it was so disturbing."
" Because Jesus is saying like I don't I'm not just here to I don't want you to just believe right? I want you to live, right? Because at the end of the day, is what you do. It's what I do. I've never makes the difference. If not, we just need to read more books of all we need to do is believe right? And no Riedel of what Lane Jones said, Elaine Jones, one of our founding pastures of our church and years ago. I heard him teach and he said this, I love this. He said unapplied, truth is like an applied paint. It doesn't do anybody any good."
 The value is in the application.
 If your faith is in a can in the corner of the garage.
" Is not doing any good and Jesus would agree applications what makes the difference. So, one of the things that God uses to blow up and grow up our faith, its application Orion centered teaching. This is why you need to get involved and stay involved and lock into some environment where somebody is opening the scripture and teaching, you not simply what to believe, but what to do with what?"
" You believe something that challenges you to live a different life. Now, simply believe different things, not simply experienced something on a Sunday because knowing without doing creates a version of faith. It creates a feeble. Fragile Faith. But following Jesus, you know, this, come on. When you decide to follow Jesus, it'll stretch your faith. It will exercise your faith. It will grow your faith. And here's why? Because following Jesus will make your life better and"
 You better not it believing it makes you better at life because he's invited us to follow and you've met people like that.
" Let's become people like that the world needs more people like that. In fact, your world, your family needs you to be like that. So let's not be content with believing true things."
 Let's not even be content with believing just all the right things. Let's act on what we claim. We Believe let's be Jesus.
" Followers and we will pick it up right there. Next time in part 3 of Faith full. But before you go 3 questions to get the conversation going or keep it going number one. If you grew up attending church, what was emphasized in the church that you grew up in. Correct theology information, application, the sacraments attendance? Number two, have you ever applied a specific teaching of scripture and looking back. It actually prepared you for a storm and number three lane, said, I'd applied. Truth is like unapplied paint. It doesn't do anybody any good."
" Can you think of an area and your life, right now? We're a bit more application. Might make a big difference maybe in a relationship. Maybe your marriage finances entertainment, time management perhaps connecting with or reconnecting with a local church. A church that provides you with handles and application, Jesus was correct. Of course, he was. Jesus, Lizard, Korea was corrected. Anyone who hears these words of his and acts on them and does the hard work of applying steps out?"
" Even when it's scary steps out, even when it does, it makes the sense steps out even when it conflicts with the worldview and perhaps the world that you live in is like building your life and building our life on a solid foundation, not if, but when the storms come, you will be ready."
" Heavenly father, thank you for preserving this teaching all these years. Thank you for the men and women whose lives, not just what they believe, but whose lives and Lifestyles have challenged Me Through The Years. Thank you for the many women who have gone before us, who weren't walk through Dark Times difficult times. And it somehow"
 they continue to trust you. We want that kind of faith and I pray that you would do whatever you need to do and that we would be willing to do whatever we need to do.
 To exercise that muscle to get it.
" Thank you for the promise. Thank you for the promise that there is a foundation that indoors, I pray that you would lead us there. And I pray that we would follow in Jesus name. Amen."
" Knowing, without doing creates weak Faith, but knowing, and doing even when it's countercultural, even when it's awkward, even when it's difficult, and we're not sure how it's going to turn out that creates extraordinary growing faith, and that's what we get to practice as we head into this week. Because most of us know a lot, this is our opportunity."
" Tunity to do what we know. I hope that you'll plan to come back next week because we're going to pick up this same discussion and we're going to take it a step further as helpful as today, has been next week, will be even more practical even more handles. So I hope that you'll plan already now to be a part of this discussion next week. And if you're our guest today, please don't forget to swing by the studio to pick up your gift. Something I think you'll enjoy using this week, so make your plans."
" To, to grab that on your way, out the door. But thank you so much for being here and I hope you have a wonderful week. We'll see you next week."
 Think it's weird.
