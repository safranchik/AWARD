God is
	1: God is like you and me. You are like God, I want you to do things that you didn't do before, but before you did them, maybe you need to consider what God wants you to do. So, you need to consider your relationship to God. He tells us we are brothers. He tells us we're brothers because we're brothers like God. You're better off as a person that has a bigger heart than God,

	2: God is in his power.

	3: God is greater than the Darkness.

	4: God is the source of my strength, and God is my strength is my strength is my love.

	5: God is like a god, it does not need you, it can provide. He's like the church you are. If you're a part of that or he's a part of that community. He's like your brother or sister. So then you've got two kids. Your brother and sister are grown men and you're one of the few children whose faith really grows together and your father's faith really gets bigger with his children, your brother, and sister. We're so glad we got that announcement. So, here's what we can do about it. So, when we first got this announcement because we had so much faith in him, and we knew that we weren't going to get him anywhere, but we have no idea how we did. You know what, this is a very good story, it will allow for this, we got this incredible relationship with Jesus, and when we got this announcement and he comes, we got the perfect

	6: God is like this. He wants us to feel inadequate and he wants us to feel inadequate.

	7: God is all.

	8: God is greater than we thought.

	9: God is good.

	10: God is God who gives voice to us.

	11: God is like a snake. It's like it's paralyzed.

	12: God is with us and he is with us forever and ever.

	13: God is good for us.

	14: God is this? If God is who we are as children of God the father is the mother is the son who is in US, is in US, I mean she's the daughter of Jesus who's in US. Jesus. That's in US and he's in US, I mean he's in US, if you want to join here, he's in US, if you want to join here today, follow him. I think most of you want to have your kids here at school but all of you just want to be your own parents as well. So, if you'd like to know more about this, you know, I want you to know I am in the middle of the storm, I want you to know I'm getting closer to Jesus. And this was so confusing for me and it's so easy to read these words of mine right?

	15: God is my shepherd who has been persecuted because of some kind of wrong, because of circumstances that do not suit him.

God will
	1: God will not forgive you.

	2: God will grow up and do what God has given him. If the Good Shepherd is the good Shepherd of sheep, the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd will grow up and do what God has given him. That's the reason why they say to me, when you pray, there's a good Shepherd there are a lot of things that they pray about that God will give them so they don't have to rely on those things. And that's what God has done. So that they can exercise all these extraordinary acts that they've been able to do with the power of prayer and the power of love.

	3: God will not let you down. There's a song that we're gonna play. Next, when we're done, Jesus walks. He says, take it easy. Listen. Listen, the things you did wrong and you're going to find it again. God, we all know that you were wrong, but we're all still going to continue. He says, take it easy. Listen, Jesus says, take it easy. Listen. Jesus, is so forgiving you're going to find it easier to forgive me. I say this, take it easy. Listen, this doesn't just fall under your control, it's going to be your control. So, I want to thank you for what you've done for me.

	4: God will come to the rescue of Jesus.

	5: God will walk with you and we will say a simple prayer to you. Thank you for this invitation and I ask that you pray for this day. This is your prayer. Our offering for your help is this morning in remembrance of your family. Thank you for the kind invitation. This is a small offering. And if you want to give some of the more generous things that I'm teaching, this is a small offering. And if you want me to be a more generous person, I'm also giving you a small portion of this offering. I will have another piece of bread that's with me in remembrance.

	6: God will take your sins and make you free from them.

	7: God will help us in this life, in the following life, we will go out, in peace. Thank you. I really pray. I pray that. I pray that I'm able to lead an active life here and lead my children. Thank you for this. Let's give thanks as God loves us. We also pray that if the world hears our prayers. God's love. There will be an eternity of rejoicing. Amen, thank you.

	8: God will make his rod and he'll lay down his life for us. For our sins will bring us to death.

	9: God will praise you and say, praise me? Look, here's what I tell you because it's your name. When we're in love, when we are broken, when we're oppressed. Jesus is. And I want you to know what I want you to do in this. You will feel this

	10: God will love you. The Peace of Christ who is with us in Jesus Christ and with all that is in us. Is the only Peace in this world. The only hope for the safety of our friends.

	11: God will come after me.

	12: God will be here at all the kingdom will be, amen.

	13: God will watch over me and love us in a great way that you're loving me in a great way in a very short period of time that you're kind of letting me down so I can say things that I don't understand at all that you're kind of making me feel inadequate at first but then you allow me to say things and it changes.

	14: God will be with you.

	15: God will come to you, that you drink and believe, that you will be saved and that you will live life on Earth, that you will be a god and that you will rise again in heaven. That you will be raised up in Heaven, that you will live in Heaven. The world will be full of your sins, and all your sins will be forgiven, and you will be saved.

I am
	1: I am so glad that you are my father, thank you for all the gifts, and I want you to know that I truly appreciate your presence and that is where you are in heaven. So thank you and thank you for your love.

	2: I am the way I am, am the way you're looking for me

	3: I am a little anxious that something like this might turn out to be very bad. So maybe the next time, you give up and give up again for something that might turn out to be very dangerous. And then I think about what might become even more dangerous and in the back of my mind, if I give up, I think of Jesus. If I give up, I give up a very big part of my faith in something like this. I think that's what I give up. Jesus is what I put up in, and that's what happens with me in these storms and I need that trust Jesus is what you put up in the storms. I need that faith in something we need in, but it's not in the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms of the storms

	4: I am in heaven. That is how Christ uses the gifts of the Holy Spirit to make the world an eternal place where he dwells within us for the world to see and to hear and to hear and to see.

	5: I am glad to have you here today, I want you to know this. I want you to know what it takes to love, the relationship that God uses in us to see things that I will never see. He uses to love all of us.

	6: I am with my brothers and sisters in Christ. Amen.

	7: I am convinced that I will never be the same.

	8: I am not afraid of God. I'm not afraid of anything at all. He's not afraid.

	9: I am a Christian and the people that I know and love them are those who love me and trust me and say the most loving words to me.

	10: I am more than just anybody. I am truly just my brother, Jesus Christ, I am the one who, in the Name of Christ, lays down my life for you.

	11: I am, that it all comes to light.

	12: I am in no way connected to the current, not even with God, I am the one who says that Jesus will be there to lead you out of this place. I have searched my heart and I just want to make sure you go back and I've learned the other side to me. When you read this and you're convinced that Jesus will lead you out, what is that?

	13: I am afraid of those who would take the lead in a dangerous world without our obedience to God's Will.

	14: I am delighted and grateful that you and your family have accepted and appreciate my presence in your family and in your community, but even before you came and you made it the case to worship a human being. This doesn't mean that you made it a Christian mission, but it does mean that you made it a human church for that reason.

	15: I am glad that I got to hear from all of you, that, although you didn't feel like I've ever been honest about where I'm going, but the world seemed to realize that I didn't have any faith.

I pray that
	1: I pray that there's nothing to hate.

	2: I pray that this will help you to know that you are not alone.

	3: I pray that you were alive and that you're able to move the ship out of the storm. You could just be out of the ship and live your life. And that's an opportunity you would find. And that doesn't even begin to lessen the anxiety. If they can't find you somewhere, they can't find you.

	4: I pray that we may all be with each other and all the world with you.

	5: I pray that no one in your name will deny your love for all those in your name because Jesus is love.

	6: I pray that God will forgive those who trespass against him, they will not forsake that which Jesus has commanded and He will never allow them to trespass against him and they will never allow them to trespass against him.

	7: I pray that you will come, and I pray that I hear you.

	8: I pray that the Lord would forgive this sorrow, but it is not a quick thing. It is not a quick thing. It is not that I'm weak, or feeble, or that I'm afraid. It's that I do what I do. I sit back and think and I'm just praying and this is what we should be. It is, in fact, the only prayer that we should be that we would not have if we did not know that God has a plan to forgive. There are things that God has made possible and it is possible that he may forgive us and that we have such confidence that He uses all the resources to put our faith in a small number of people.

	9: I pray that you see Jesus. He can change the world. Amen.

	10: I pray that you know how we don't need to go through a storm. They'll just keep in mind that sometimes, sometimes, people don't really know and sometimes, they just want to watch what they see. They don't believe that Jesus is real and doesn't belong anywhere. That's just, we know that Jesus can't go through a storm. That's just because of God. And you know what Jesus isn't, you know what's even more amazing is when you look at people who are going through these storms that's that, that's what's most remarkable is when we look at people who are living in a situation where you don't feel adequate when they're in the hospital, when they're being treated or you get sick

	11: I pray that you will do this for me. That you will help us in our lives. That you will help us for us for our children, that you will do your. That you will make us better. I pray that you will help us in these and other.

	12: I pray that we do not have to live with our sins and that we do not have to dwell with all that we have to do with.

	13: I pray that those who care about this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. If there's a problem with a person, you ask for forgiveness, Jesus makes a deal with you. So, if there's a question, you want to talk about forgiveness and Jesus is in the spirit. If you, you want to talk about forgiveness, it's something I'm gonna have to tell you. Jesus has already done with

	14: I pray that we all know that Jesus is the Christ because of his love for us and his love and his peace. And yet, in spite of this, his faithfulness to us is no longer adequate to the world. He is no longer adequate to our needs.

	15: I pray that God's in control of your hearts and you will find him in this place, in this place. And so help me to help them in the struggle you're struggling. That's why I wanted to say today that I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. You.

We pray that
	1: We pray that we can make all of our lives easier for some of you to hear.

	2: We pray that the storm that we're facing would have stopped in time. Because that day has begun again. When the storm approached in time,

	3: We pray that some of us, perhaps, might have a way to be baptized and that some of us, maybe, are looking for that other way of life that's so much safer. Our lives could be clearer because we're safer. We know that we don't have to live in fear or in fear of. And then when fear gets to the stage. So let me tell you something. In the middle of all of this, one of the things I'm most encouraged about in life is knowing what the future holds. And when all of this stuff just happens, but when anxiety doesn't, and when stress doesn't.

	4: We pray that he may be patient with us and let us praise him. He is my father's son. Thank you to you for being a part of my faith.

	5: We pray that in our community that we have some of the muscle and strength of an army. The muscle that can't stand just because the power of our community.

	6: We pray that God will continue to protect these children and our families and help us to put them in the hands of Christ. The father's love and our strength is stronger than the world and will continue to be stronger in the same place where the father has been persecuted and all that he has done to sow fear and hatred in these little hearts of ours will have no fear. We pray that God, who sent me to protect these children from the world, you can trust God, you can rely on him to do all that. You can trust him to give you the strength in the world.

	7: We pray that you and I, if that were to be our faith, we would have a greater confidence in your goodness and in Jesus Christ, even though we believe in a few things at the same time.

	8: We pray that all of us can gather together and bow down to God and receive from God's loving presence and help. That we're able to remain together and to live in such a way that we can trust in one another to move in the right direction and that we can turn out the wrong way.

	9: We pray that the person in the room with us who claims to be a savior. He's the one who says, it's okay to be a liar, and so, you know, I'd like you guys to come over here and we're going to have this conversation and I'm gonna tell you who says, I'm not a good father, I'm not a good husband, I'm not a good husband, I'm not a good father, I'm not a good husband. I'm not a good father.

	10: We pray that we would never do that again.

	11: We pray that you may hear us.

	12: We pray that you can be my Shepherd and I pray that you will be that Shepherd in your own life. I pray that your will not be done in the name of other than Jesus Christ in the name of the church of your ancestors, that you may lead us through this season and help us through this world into the future. I pray that you have your body and the Holy Spirit in Heaven and Earth, that you will do the same.

	13: We pray that one day the power of God may again exercise his power over us and our minds.

	14: We pray that this is the day that we are to be saved. We pray that this is the day that the faith that we have in Christ is being restored. Christ is making a new covenant. Let's pray that the faith that we have in Christ remains intact. We pray that the faith that we have in Christ is being restored. Let's pray that these words that he wrote about

	15: We pray that we may turn out like this. We sing like this.

I hope that
	1: I hope that you will give you that to be a part of this ministry of our Lord. Thank you for that. Thank you for that. Thank you for that, thank you for that, thank you for the opportunity to have such a wonderful group of people and all kinds of businesses, the businesses and the people that we've met.

	2: I hope that when our hearts are open and honest about who we really are, when we trust what we actually have, we will be able to truly grasp the truth of who we truly are, and who we truly truly are.

	3: I hope that this week brings you a new, cool and different kind of story to come back to.

	4: I hope that if we could help make the world a better place, as a people, one that can grasp and help us, and then that we could help us realize the joy of being an adult and begin to grow in it, that we could begin to grasp the joy that we experienced in being an adult and that we could truly rejoice in that we had grown in it.

	5: I hope that you are. Because Jesus did a great job with his disciples. He showed up and he's showing us something that we already know in life.

	6: I hope that that these stories of love and kindness to those of us who were lied about by these storms, that we were lied about again and again, that we were not really made for life by others. Those of us who were simply in relationships with those who were liars because we were able to meet the needs of those who were just lying about things to themselves, were not actually made for life as much as

	7: I hope that you, like me. But I also hope that you, like me, you'll, like me. Like me and share with us the love that Jesus wants. That you'll be loved as we have, with us, and that you'll be loved with us.

	8: I hope that this reminds us of the times where there were so many who would just give their lives.

	9: I hope that he's here and that he's got some kind of relationship with us and you, maybe a little bit of a relationship to his brother Fred. So, you know, if we're reading this, if you went, you know, I was trying to find a little relationship and I think I've discovered.

	10: I hope that I don't feel guilty for the actions of those who followed us.

	11: I hope that it's possible to find someone who would do for me when that day is come, what happens with us? The people who support us, when that day is come, are those whose lives are at risk?

	12: I hope that we will come to this together and we'll come to this in the Name of Jesus Christ. Jesus is one of us and is the Shepherd of the Sheep. He will be with us. The one who calls out for us. The one who commands the Sheep. The one who lays down his life for us and assures us, "

	13: I hope that that you are the only one who hears this. Listen, listen and God heals. Listen and you will hear him. Listen and you will grow up to see and understand that when I tell you I hear these words from my mouth, I said it in the name of the Lord, and forgive them, and draw them from the vine. If you would give them to me. I would use your blood for healing your sins as well as for the healing of your sick and for the peace of your grief.

	14: I hope that God will love you. He doesn't. He doesn't know what we're doing right now in our lives. He doesn't know if you are like him.

	15: I hope that you like this story and you know we grew up in that one day in church. In church, we were taught that if someone said a million, we don't need to know God in our lives. But if our families wanted, if they wanted to be in control, our faith grew and grew in that one day, our faith grew in control of the church when we were kids and grew to love our neighbors even when we were parents and grew up in a different time.

Dear God
	1: Dear God we would also invite you to come to this service today and join us in honor of the coming Feast of the New Covenant.

	2: Dear God for this. I'm still trying to get that out of my head but I've gotten to the point that the message of Jesus is that all of us in God's faith gets bigger. So as we get bigger, you guys in the gospel are bigger and bolder. The more bold that our faith gets bigger and bolder, we get bigger. So now you guys are growing in the gospel and you're starting to find your feet in the real world

	3: Dear God. Lord have mercy on us. God is our Lord and savior and this is why I pray today. He is my Shepherd and I pray that you would know the way to repent. I pray that you would know that you would know the way to love us.

	4: Dear God, when you are forgiven, God is compassionate with you.

	5: Dear God has given us something that he gives us that we feel like we get to feel like we know what's right here.

	6: Dear God in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

	7: Dear God, make us believe in Jesus. This is what's going to turn out in the end and we all know what is going on in the end, there is nothing that can't go away and change the course of the Christian world. This is what God wants you to experience. This is what Jesus is trying to do through his grace and what he's trying to do through his obedience to his will and with what he's doing through his love, Jesus wants us to follow him and not follow the way he said and so that's the world.

	8: Dear God? What we have done in this life is to create, that people will do things with their minds, that we will do things with our hearts. Jesus says, he will give us the peace of Heaven and Earth and then he leaves us with the power of this, this is what he wants us to hear and believe this is what is in store for him is that as we get closer, we begin to get to know and experience this very deep and difficult life with this very short frame, with his teaching and his teachings, I know this as much as I ever will. The

	9: Dear God you would always stay with us.

	10: Dear God, you took me to this land in the middle of these storms, in the middle of these storms.

	11: Dear God. As God gives us hope. God's spirit. And so God, who has sent me down is always with me. And as God has given me hope, I want to use that in the 21st century as well, as it was with Jesus. I want to use that in my relationship with the disciples. We talked about what Jesus would do if we're ever going to confront our sin that sin against all of us that we believe and believe it's not possible.

	12: Dear God help us, all that we love and believe is love from God, not simply a muscle.

	13: Dear God, you can only trust me with your life. I dare you to do that instead of the only way you can trust me with your life, and maybe even with your life because the only way I could ever trust you with that would be to deny all the trust that's already in the water. I can only imagine that's it. You know what's more? There is no way you can guarantee that my life will never be taken because you didn't trust me enough. You didn't believe me enough because you know, you bet on me.

	14: Dear God, he is loving.

	15: Dear God that I'll be able to attend church and I'll be able to provide a safe and loving environment where I can be a faithful brother to God. Thank you. You that is so, so, so good. We thank you that is so, so good, you know, we love you. Thank you for that.

The devil is

	2: The devil is in the details. In fact, there are several things that you can do to lessen your fear.

	3: The devil is in the house. In the yard? Don't let them in the house. Nobody touches you, you never let anybody in the house, you never let anybody in the house hear you, listen, Jesus made you live, you know what? Listen, listen. Listen to me. Listen. Listen to Jesus again. Listen. You're doing. Listen. Jesus took you to his house. And you're doing that again, look, there's more room.

	5: The devil is so big, that it seems to be the shepherd. Look how small is it. I want you to step in and help us get back there.

	6: The devil is my friend. He is My Shepherd. Jesus knows how to care. He doesn't ever tell people that Jesus cares about them and that he has mercy. And he's not afraid to betray his people and live as they will and as they will live their lives in peace.

	7: The devil is in the details. It's getting late to work, he's got a little extra time, so they got him a few more minutes and he says he's going to finish this text. Thank you very much. I just want to thank you. For taking time and I would love to give my life to. But thank you so much for being here and for believing like Jesus said, that the body of Christ, that will never be destroyed, that Jesus is the Good Shepherd of the sheep. And the only sheep that will remain, the only sheep that will ever be forsaken.

	8: The devil is with us. The Lord in me and I in you and I in you and I in you. Lord, when you come, you will hear it, no more. I will not lift your voice but you will.

	11: The devil is in our hearts.

	12: The devil is on our side. The devil is with us. He is with us. He is with us. He is with us. He is with us. He is with us. And when we have given thanks to God for our sins, we confess them to have forgiven us.

	13: The devil is in the details, there is no such thing as a perfect Circle of Christ when it comes to what is beautiful in heaven, you will see it. And it's so much easier.

	14: The devil is in our midst. He has put an end to us. He has called his children to do harm. In fact he has made some children to do harm,

	15: The devil is with us. In this whole world, the real bread and the real bread, for all that we're fed is in the hands of the children of God, and the whole world. The world,

The devil will
	1: The devil will twist their arm and they will fall down and he will cast in them the sword.

	2: The devil will come to the rescue, and he'll make a deal.

	3: The devil will twist you

	4: The devil will come after you, I say.

	5: The devil will lay down his life, not for us.

	6: The devil will take care of it.

	7: The devil will love you, as he loves them, as he loves their father, as he loves his son.

	8: The devil will cast it out so that only darkness and darkness dwells.

	9: The devil will not lead us until we give.

	10: The devil will do. It is difficult to believe all the things that God did through the mouth of Moses. He made himself available to God for those who would challenge their faith. And then

	11: The devil will come and take your life.

	12: The devil will punish these evil people. He will say,

	13: The devil will be with us.

Only God will do the things that they're going to do, the things that you may not allow him to do, the things that you may not allow God to do. He will take the lives that you love so dearly and then he will take their lives and you can love them.

Money is
	1: Money is a way of life.

	2: Money is the love that God has for us. It's the love that grows in our hearts and in every relationship,

	3: Money is so strong in this community, it would take a miracle for that group to lose. You know, that group. You don't even need to have a GPA, right? I mean, they don't have a GPA. But, hey, it's a big deal. It's a big deal. You need to have all this

	4: Money is a kind of community that you are growing up in, and you're also growing up in a community that's struggling financially. That's a community that desperately needs a savior. That's a community that's slowly losing their faith that the savior isn't in the past, but they need something. They need help. They need this. They need it for something deeper. So they need this.

	5: Money is what facilitates our faith.

	6: Money is what we believe is what we think.

	7: Money is kind of hard to talk about, but it is practical.

	8: Money is the currency that keeps our lives free, from shame and shame, for eternity.

	9: Money is a lot of money.

	10: Money is a small investment, but it's a massive investment that creates jobs and creates economic development, as well, and that the world's largest consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer of consumer, and so that we're able to get those applications off the back of

	11: Money is that? That is amazing. Thank you so much for saying that. When we went to church, our response was, hey, hey, don't tell anybody how to do that. I mean, we weren't ready to do that. So this is why we think it's great. We're like, that's kind of cool. This is the way of God right now. Listen, that's what Jesus says in Matthew 16. Jesus doesn't say, you don't know this. He says, thank you. It's not true. I know it. Jesus says, he says it doesn't mean no.

	12: Money is what Jesus calls it. That's the way we look at it. So I want you to know what I mean. I'm kind of an odd one, because when Jesus talked about how we're supposed to be people, if you look at Jesus as if you were born in this world and we don't know if the disciples were Jesus or not, that's just weird.

	13: Money is such a good feeling knowing you're loved. And what if it doesn't feel like it. It doesn't feel like it? And what if I'm not a fan of it, when I'm in your life, when I'm in your relationship, it is such a good feeling knowing you're loved. So let's say my husband is no longer around my wife. Let me say you have an incredible influence in my life. Look at this. Look at this. Listen and I'm just gonna say, Listen, I understand why I'm losing it. If you have an idea.

	14: Money is not the savior.

	15: Money is a great tool for the church. So let's say, some time in your life, you think about, right? Well, when you tell someone to tell someone what to believe, they know how to use it? They know how to use it and they will trust you to keep that faith alive in that life and you will grow in your faith with these elements in your life. When the winds blow, I don't want anybody else to go through the whole process and put that in a piece of paper that's supposed to be in their hand. And then we're going to put that in the hands of one of the people and we're going to put that in the newspaper and print it at your local church and then when the ink is gone, right?

Wealth is
	1: Wealth is to us the life of God.

	2: Wealth is not self-interest.

	3: Wealth is in our Hearts.

	4: Wealth is a great thing, right?

	5: Wealth is power over time, and all of us to have the power over the fear of this world because of this fear, if only all our power and the confidence in God's goodness is with us. And if only all our belief and the confidence in God's goodness is with us. And if only you are with us. If only we were with them. And if only you are with us. God's justice is real, if only we believed and believed. So.

	6: Wealth is the measure of that which God has given us.

	7: Wealth is the power of goodness. This is what we were all created for. This is what we call the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd will lead our lives to the Good Shepherd. But this is what Jesus says in Matthew 25, when he says it is easier for them to be kind, to be kind to each other, the Holy Spirit is in the balance, it is the shepherd of good cheerfulness, the Healer of ill, the Shepherd of bitterness, the Shepherd of bitterness, the shepherd of bitterness, the Healer of compassion, the shepherd of hunger, the shepherd of hatred. This is what we call the Good Shepherd.

	8: Wealth is just like what we have heard Jesus says before, when I am in this world that we have nothing left to lose and we have the power and the resources of God with us in such a small world that we can feed our families, provide our water, provide our food and provide our health care. This means more to us than being left behind at night.

	9: Wealth is the reason we keep running out of cash. So what's a good faith faith idea? That's what Jesus taught.

	10: Wealth is for the children of God

	11: Wealth is a big question. This issue isn't the big one. It's the one that's a question that I believe it's a bigger question that we really think about, and we all of a sudden we kind of begin to think about in a different light and we think about this or we think about this in an even more different light, about this issue. This was so real, there are so many ways. So it's time to explore it again, not just to you

	12: Wealth is what we feel is happening to us in our community, in our family, and our friends.

	13: Wealth is the first and only thing. You can be in the first. It's our First Feebo.

	14: Wealth is for those who are willing to look and who are kind to their neighbors, we thank you for being with us. Thank you.

	15: Wealth is atrophied, but we can still give it to the hungry. Now, in our world, we are a burden. So, you know, we go to great lengths and we would be a burden on ourselves. Now, we will never give up and give up, our freedom, and our humanity and we pray that your heavenly father, who is in heaven, be with us. You will bless us in this somber moment that all of us are in, amen.

It is good to
	1: It is good to have some friends. I know that one of your buddies that we're close friends and we would love to know their name. I just would like to know what kind of person you are. I just want to let you know. I know you are in the life of a Good Shepherd. I want you to know that you love, you know, all of us and we are a family, we're all here to help you. We're all here to love the other. We all share in all of us. We all look like we are the ones in the middle of this fight because we don't have the resources.

	2: It is good to share the joy with others because the world may be quite busy, busy, busy, busy with you and Jesus, but in fact, we need to be in our presence because the world is in need of us.

	3: It is good to see how God uses love.

	4: It is good to have something for your kids

	5: It is good to be a guest. My brother who is with us, he said that the father was afraid of us and he said that he saw us come in. And the father said this is how things should go. So he took his son and his wife. And he said to them that the father had said this is how things should go? He was afraid of us because they were afraid of our coming in. So they turned their back eyes. So Jesus said this is the way things should go with us. When Jesus finished, the disciples came and said this is the way things should go. And when he had finished, he said, come forth and worship me.

	6: It is good to have friends that are doing the kind of thing that we did, that we met. We don't just love each other.

	7: It is good to know that you will always be that Christ is in this world today and I want you to know that I will be back.

	8: It is good to remember when this is our time of remembrance, when Jesus will not fade, when we pray and when we proclaim his name. He will give thanks to God for your remembrance and praise and praise. You are forgiven me.

	9: It is good to have that confidence. We've done it over the years in hopes that we might find what we need in life in the world. And so, I'm really glad we have that confidence of knowing that we're living in the real world and doing something about it. We think of all the things that we need in life. And that's what I hope when we trust, when we see Jesus, we know that there's a chance that there's an extraordinary possibility that we're living with, and that we're enduring life in a world that was created to create the perfect, perfect world and so God uses all of this to turn things around and to give us hope and to have the power of reason and reason

	10: It is good to have a Shepherd.

	11: It is good to observe the love and the generosity of other churches that have compassion for you for others, that we find you as we do to be loving because of a feeling.

	12: It is good to know that we have a plan. As we face the storm in coming days and begin to prepare, if you and I ever experience any storminess or stress or anxiety on any part of our lives, it would be the worst. And if you experience any of these, you would experience anxiety, depression, that would truly paralyze us. And if you're a parent, I would truly, truly hope that that your child has experienced anxiety or stress or depression anxiety as well. So that they would have an opportunity to experience that with you and with me when we have a storm or a stormy place in their lives, or when we have an issue. We always tell our children that God has created this perfect storm to respond. That we need it to respond to. So thank you for your time.

	13: It is good to know that, when we feel that, whatever our fears, whatever our fears are, no matter their source, if we feel that God is in control of our fears, we can be very glad that God is with us.

	14: It is good to observe people that we're kind of like, Jesus wants us to stay where we're going. And he says that they could leave, they could not leave him alone because he didn't leave. I want, I want you to be there as well. And for as they walked into the door, they knew, they didn't have anything to lose and they felt like he didn't want us to leave, but when they stepped into the door, he just gave them a hug. His mouth was like this, right? You, you know, I want you to feel his compassion for me. Like he wanted it to happen. It was amazing to him. It was an emotional experience. It was an incredible feeling. Just because Jesus is giving you what he wants

	15: It is good to see a real love, a real trust in us, a real relationship that we share and a real relationship between the good, the bad and the ugly in the world. A real relationship with each other.

We need to
	1: We need to focus on your opportunities to engage in these opportunities and create a tangible, tangible and tangible impact on their lives. We need to get our students ready for the middle school. If our students are going to be able to attend our programs, if our students are able to attend our online education, you can schedule a seminar or online course, we'll schedule and we will provide online resources to facilitate and encourage you to participate in our programs, online and in person.

	2: We need to be disciplined. There's no reason to say that God is perfect or that we don't have to do anything.

	3: We need to stand with you now. This. This is my prayer that our savior and my savior.

	4: We need to make a difference. And so in the meantime, let's say thank you to Jesus. So, the day that you were released from this solitary place, you gave up your identity and walked out. We have a very strong feeling of being in a world without all of us. Like no one.

	5: We need to take action to make sure that we don't allow people to steal our freedoms.

	6: We need to be reminded that they're a part of our community and that when we're in love, all the love in Christ and all the love in the world and all the healing of our sin, all the love, all the love and all the light of Jesus Christ to you and forever. Thank you so much for your love and generosity.

	7: We need to be able to do with others.

	8: We need to look at this and we can say, this is a storm, that was kind of happening.

	9: We need to begin to grasp the roots of how our faith intersects with how we see and hear our neighbor.

	10: We need to find a place where we can truly understand the world around us and then allow this to get real. We cannot be silent and we must be content with merely believing what we need to believe because if we cannot find an understanding of the world around us, then then we no longer have a voice of reason. And the world around us is the one that needs to be dismissed.

	11: We need to have our trust in you. Do what you say, do what you put into practice, do what you make your voice known and do things with that kind of confidence, and make our relationship stronger. And we all have confidence.

	12: We need to be reminded of what these gentlemen did in the great American church and the wonderful lives that they lived. If we don't understand, we don't care.

	13: We need to make this in the real world, that Jesus did not live long, let us begin our daily service today, that we would go, and that we would be grateful to you, our guests. Thank you for coming. So thank you for the invitation to go and for sharing your food and your love of Christ with us for the first time this year and to pray at a service in your presence to facilitate the service. And so, it's always very encouraging to share our goodness. And so that we pray together with you for the First time this year. And then, it is quite cool to share with you that our guests are delighted about being here today. And so, it is great to welcome you into this meeting for the first time in their lives to be here today for our worship. But we believe this is a good opportunity for all of us in their lives to worship, so that we can help you with our finances, or with your scholarships.

	14: We need to learn how to be a better father to be a better father for Jesus. And so that was the focus of our conversation. And then we added something that's a little bit different and it's a little different and it's not in a very practical way. What happens? Well I mean I don't know, right? Well the first thing that happens that changes what happens is that you don't want to say or be like, we will say, amen, we will go home.

	15: We need to make a difference and I've got a very short time. So I just want to say thanks for joining us. We're so glad you're here today. It's very emotional because we were traveling with you and our family to an event in a small group. It was so close. My husband and I would have wept that night. I think because we were so close and our parents and we were so anxious. But here's the thing. It was so much easier because we were so sure that this was going to be another wonderful time.

Do not
	1: Do not give up that you have your hand.

	2: Do not make those kinds of deals, it's not like he just signed this up for that and he signed up for all this stuff and Jesus wants his children to have. I mean he wants his family. If there's one place in heaven that God has sent his son, one way or another, that's the kingdom of Heaven. Now when Jesus hears these words and he says I believe it was sent, God sent his son, one way or another.

	3: Do not allow the people.

	4: Do not be afraid.

	5: Do not be afraid. The faith gets weaker in the years that follow, because even though you're not sure where Faith is, you know, and you're afraid

	6: Do not allow us to bow and observe others to that table as we would the table in order to see what we saw and hear what we saw.

	7: Do not trust any god except God to decide how our world is going to work out.

	8: Do not be afraid, I pray, this morning that you would let us know that our neighbor is faithful in Christ and just. We pray that you would let us know that Jesus is the Christ.

	9: Do not make us fools.

	10: Do not let it get in your way. The world can no longer be silent and you can still feel it. Even if it's in your head, your mind goes blank. You feel like you're out of control. It's getting in your way now. If you don't talk enough or if you don't follow up, you're sitting back. You think that you're a failure. You're like this. You're doing something different. You're in your head. You're like this, this, this, this

	11: Do not, do not be afraid. As the father and the father, what's in this place, go get your brother and sister. Listen to what he has to say. Let the father go with you. If you can help it and I would gladly help him with something good that's in this place and that we don't know exactly. It's like the wind is blowing, right? Look, this is just such a good feeling. Like this wind was pushing down and this was just like, this was just, like, you know, this is really cool and this is really cool and you know how we feel. And he just said, listen. Look, they tried to twist you when it was really, really difficult. They got really, really disruptive to do that, when it was, you know, all this stuff, you just didn't know what to do. You don't. That's when it got really difficult.

	12: Do not let your anger take control. Instead, we pray for the storm to wash over us. And when the storm comes, all of a sudden the storm will engulf us and paralyze us. So let your thoughts and your actions turn to our sorrow. It will engulf us and paralyze us until we find peace. Jesus is coming.

	13: Do not do that. In spite of the fact that it's a big deal. You know, I'm the editor of a very popular newspaper that's in fact the largest newspaper of the United States but I don't want you to imagine that it wouldn't fit into our schedules, it wouldn't work that well. And so I think that would be a terrible, terrible mistake to make. My advice to you is go ahead with your schedule and do whatever it takes but that's not enough. If it's not enough, we should probably just go back to what we did in the past.

	14: Do not let him deceive you, do not let him betray you. There are places. Here's the deal, if the storm comes and blows your door and it's already been hit by a storm this weekend, you could say the storm comes all the time. But when you actually see the storm come to an end, maybe it's just your imagination, maybe you didn't feel like the storm came.

	15: Do not rush to do it. When this is finished I will have you and your staff members there for our funeral. We don't have time until the service begins and then we will do the rest and then I want you to know this we have several baskets of food and then we can place the baskets together and then we can make one of the chairs for our funeral service. I wanted to do this kind of thing with something that we usually don't do and just to say thank you for being here, thank you so much. Now is just going to be an interesting conversation because these were some of the things that you have said. This is just going to be an interesting relationship because here are some of you. You know, these are those of you that are kind of like in a way that is maybe mirroring. And you are kind of mirroring. It's something that I didn't get to experience or kind of in a way that was kind of like mirroring that reflected, you know, perhaps you are in a different way.

You should know that
	1: You should know that all the different elements of your life are not just the same as these relationships. But if we want to know what it's like for someone who's not like us and in comparison, I have no shame. I can't let him down and I feel no shame. I had no shame.

	2: You should know that we're living in a big city that we're meeting together for a meal. We've been meeting together for lunch since 2010 at the Lakewood Lakeside Community Church in Lakewood, Georgia. Our service today at 3 p.m. and at the Lakeside Church for a meal. We're having a variety of different events throughout the day. We'll be sharing handles with people around here to get you ready for the service, but we're also just glad that you're in our area, and we're delighted that you're on the other side.

	3: You should know that a couple who were paralyzed by fear of God, they were paralyzed by fear of all the darkness and the storms that came and went.

	4: You should know that it's actually a beautiful image, right? When it's in the center. And when it's out in front of you, the truth is, when the center is empty, Jesus says to his disciples and says, this is the one who taught the teaching the disciples, the one who taught us that we're not children of sin, we should not feel like we're children of the world. That he taught us that we don't need to worry about anyone, ever. But what about the children of God? What if the father is not there?

	5: You should know that when a homeowner says they want to do this with their family, they're not just saying this over the phone. It's not that they're not giving up. They're asking to do this with their kids. They're not simply saying this. They are asking to do this in their garage or someplace in their garage.

	6: You should know that these are really, really hard words. Because when we say these things, what we're really trying to say is what Jesus says. Okay. There's one last thing. Hey look, we're talking about what we're like so we just let's get back to talking about. It's so amazing that we have one last phrase and how it changes our worldview. Now, if you think about it, then it creates a kind of fear and it's quite funny. If you put them in your head, there's this.

	7: You should know that in a few minutes, you would know this would be different if you were a part of the community and you were a writer. Now, how about we follow you on Twitter? Do you have a message to give? I know that's not what you need or you wouldn't have that kind of bandwidth. We could be reading, you know,

	8: You should know that if you're going to be honest with yourself, you need to trust me to be honest with you. You need to trust Jesus. You need to trust me to be honest with you, if you want to be honest with Jesus, you need to trust me to be honest with you. And you need to trust me.

	9: You should know that my family and that I've done as an organ of the church you give, your trust, your love. I'm sure that you trust us to love you and it's going to give you a different kind of confidence. You know what my brother does?

	10: You should know that you would have done that to yourself, right? Because some of us, we can say, in the Bible, if you had known better, maybe we would have done something different. And the disciples said, Jesus, you are better than I am.

	11: You should know that you're not alone. You have thousands of other people in the world, in a similar situation that we have and we all have different degrees of social anxiety. When you do a test that's not going to turn out exactly what you're hoping for.

	12: You should know that. It says that you're all entitled. We all deserve a shot at our health care or we should have a shot at God's health care or maybe our health care's going to hurt and maybe even our lives. But our safety is no longer in question. It's in question.

	13: You should know that you are good at all of us and you are not that bad, but you are good at your own, and your name is Jesus, Christ, you are loved. You are praised for your name.

	14: You should know that Jesus is a faithful and loving father of children who loves them. If they follow me, I will continue to love them and help them make their way to heaven. If they follow me and give him their freedom and hope in Jesus way, and the way, what we do in heaven, the father of all nations, has given them that freedom. The freedom to make their way through me, and this is where I love you. The freedom that's in the bread and the cup to be enjoyed by your Lord.

	15: You should know that it's not about that. It's not about that, it's not about that. It's not about that. It's not about that because it's not about that. It's not about that because what is it about? Is it about the fact that you're living through, that you have a faith that you can trust yourself? That you can trust others

God said
	1: God said, even though you have known Jesus,

	2: God said.

	3: God said, he's a hero for everybody.

	4: God said in part one,


	5: God said,

	6: God said to his disciples. Come in, stand among us. There we have seen the Son of man and the Holy Spirit that dwelleth within you. Pour out your Spirit upon us. Praise, and worship him in worship. Let us pray that you might be with us and with your spirit, that you may be with us and with your light, that you may be with your spirit. We have seen the Holy Spirit when you sat on the right hand of God and the Holy Spirit on the left, that God might have mercy on you.

	7: God said the truth was revealed to him with God's hand and we pray for you today.

	8: God said the father sent the son to die and his son received the Holy Spirit.

	9: God said so.

	10: God said, he said to me, it was good for you, it was Good for the Lord. So don't you have to wait for the rain. And the streams are running. But the winds, and waves, and all that, are crashing in here in my heart. That's the message of this song. He says this in three parts. Forgive me but forgive me.

	11: God said I am Jesus. I am John the Baptist and this morning, I pray you for my life. You will always have something for me. You will never have anything for me for granted. And I pray you to continue to pray for my life and the lives of others.

	12: God said this. When Jesus went in his house and saw the crowds, it was the first time he had gone in. He took the place where he had stood for the first time, and he took the place where his house had stood for the first time and he healed three sick people in the house.

	13: God said, my mother had a gift, that he gave to her and she gave it to me when she was in school. Now, you have got to go home. I mean, look at her and she had such a limp and she had such a large limp. And I feel like maybe she was just a little bit too frail and they knew what she was doing, it was probably not right for them. And so the next morning at the end of my lesson, I want to ask you to please pray for me and Jesus is there. And Jesus says, okay, I want you to thank me for everything that you're doing. For giving me this gift of hope.

	14: God said to Moses, I want you to believe that Jesus is my Shepherd. You don't have to believe me. But I want you to think of what you already know. Here's how it went down.

	15: God said, the father did not love his son in the flesh, but in spirit, and in acts of his will. The father gave himself up for the wicked. The son gave himself up for the father who has not done what is in him. He gave himself up for the father who has done what is in him. Be not deceived. I say to you, when we hear you say this, the father loved the son because he had done what was in him.

Jesus said
	1: Jesus said to me,

	2: Jesus said that there are all that we have in common with God.

	3: Jesus said it best. There are five kinds of goodness, there's five different kinds of goodness.

	4: Jesus said this to me, Jesus.

	5: Jesus said, that they would come and live.

	6: Jesus said, this is what we're gonna do. This is what God is looking at us when we look at the mirror and we are like, we really don't know this guy right now, and that's Jesus, but maybe we should be surprised that he's in the headlines for being named in the Bible. There was something about him that said, you know, this is what we're gonna do. Jesus is looking at you. We need to step out of here. It's going to be a change of clothes. Right? We need to take whatever it is you're wearing at the end of the day. What we're going to do with you, if you're in your thimble. I mean, you're in your little thimble you'll be in the middle of it. And you'll be in there next to the basket you're in. There's a whole other story that goes on around in our church today because we go into the church with three or four chairs and you look at what we've done with our chairs and you look like you're going to have two chairs next to the basket you're in, but if you've got a chair, you'll find it easier to turn it upside down

	7: Jesus said, Lord, there are many of us who live in the shadow of those who sin against us, and who were cast out by Jesus Christ. As I said it in Matthew, chapter 3, verse 21, how in Jesus name, forgive us. God forgive us. Do this, Jesus Christ. You give us this, forgive us. When I was in the midst of the crowd, I felt this, this was the Holy Spirit in me. And this is your Holy Spirit that I will give you, forgive us. Give us this, forgive us this. You will be with us for ever. And when I was saying this, when I had spoken these things to my disciples, Jesus came and laid down his life for them. When I had said this,

	8: Jesus said to the disciples, He said, when the disciples saw that the disciples were amazed and when the disciples saw that the disciples were amazed, they said, This is what we have heard, that's what Jesus modeled himself, based on his teaching that the disciples would see him as an amazing. They would see him as an extraordinary. And when the disciples saw that, they thought that the great man had modeled him by the disciples, when they saw that, they thought that the world that Jesus had modeled was more beautiful and different from what he had modeled when they met that. So, this is what they'll do in Jesus name, amen.

	9: Jesus said that they would give the son of man, who's with the devil and lead the oppressed, he gave the life of the lamb to the lamb.

	10: Jesus said, these people who did not hear Jesus was liars and deceiving, for a century of their lives, they did hear Jesus saying this, how come they did not even know Jesus? I see. Like, they can't see God, they're just thinking. He says this is crazy. He says that's how it went down, that's how it went down. And then, in a few minutes, a few of you were like, he just says this right. So here we go, Jesus was so adamant about saying this, you know, I need to do something with this, you know,

	11: Jesus said:

	12: Jesus said,

	13: Jesus said to Peter, take the bread. Now the whole word of life is in this verse that says I give it to you, that whoever believes in me does not have to say, I give it to them. I don't have to be afraid. But I give you something to eat. If you believe that

	14: Jesus said to John, and Jesus said, Let's say this, amen. You're our guest, your guests are our guests, right? Good night. Jesus said, we do love you. Amen.

	15: Jesus said

The Bible says
	1: The Bible says,

	2: The Bible says we are commanded to be a people of God. We were commanded to love Jesus.

	3: The Bible says that the father, or father's brother, in every person, is the one that feeds.

	4: The Bible says God the Father who sent his only son, Jesus Christ, that is the father and the only begotten Son of God. Jesus Christ is Lord of lords and savior of the world, his Only Begotten Son who brings peace to all things and invites all things to pass by, and assures us that the supper and the thanksgiving are for him, amen.

	5: The Bible says that there are three streams. The sun, the moon and the far reaches of the Heavens. It says that each of them have power, and that they were given by heaven, which is the highest heaven.

	6: The Bible says of God there is no middle way but the way Jesus died and the way he died is the one who remains in that is in the middle. The one who dies in the middle. He's the one who heals, says that the first thing that comes to mind, right? Is there something that Jesus did that was not recorded in a recorded text? Maybe it was recorded on the cross, but it's actually recorded on the screen, you know, the screen that says this is what happened? And the words of Jesus the Resurrection were, "

	7: The Bible says that the father gives you.

	8: The Bible says,

	9: The Bible says that God made man for his own.
