God is
	1: God is with us in everything, we go to church on, but only when we need a priest or even a priest we go to church on Sunday when the blood has been shed. So, we go to church on Wednesday for a prayer or a prayer to God. What are you waiting for?

	2: God is, I know that. But God is. Father, this is the time when God's grace can get through to you, to you, to take hold of your life, and let us pray for you through. In your life, we're going through. We may not be able to get to you. We need to know your life before we get to you. When we get to you and then we want to get to you before you go to bed and we want to take your life and let us pray for you. The power of God.

	3: God is the author of everything, he's the author of it and you're the author of everything. That's why we are heirs of the Lord that are heirs of Jesus Christ. That is our purpose. That's why we are heirs of Jesus Christ. That's why we have children.

	4: God is.

	5: God is called. He was saved because of me and also because of her. So if we let him call himself, Lord in the name of Jesus the son of God. Lord is all about us. And we serve him. So we serve God. And we serve him. So let's show God how we can do that. So that we can live with Christ. So he's telling us what to do and to do what we have to do.

	6: God is our sanctuary.

	7: God is great, we need a strong leadership because we can't keep our folks in an ever shifting relationship because we don't have the leadership for life. Pastor, who do you believe in? We can't keep our folks in an ever shifting relationship because we're stuck in a gray area. Pastor, no, we're stuck. Pastor, that's why we believe in life. Pastor! You believe in that? Why not get to believe in it?

	8: God is the fruit of God's labor.

	9: God is my sanctuary. She is a saint. You may be a shepherd of our Lord. It's a part of me being a little man. It's not that there's anything wrong about what you were doing that led up to Jesus as an apostle. He said in the name of Jesus is my refuge. You have to be that you live and have a plan as Jesus is the refuge of the people as you can't have a plan as I live on the other side of the house as I can't have any plan but that we were living on the other side of the house.

	10: God is the same thing as you saying I'm telling you. The Bible says, all this morning, we're going to do what I said, that God just says is not the same thing as what he says is. He's different. It's not like he did it and it's not like he did it. No. There's a difference. Not like when we do something, we do it for. You don't say it because it was the same way. It's not like his God.

	11: God is more powerful than any power that I can have. When we see him, we think we can see him in the sky, so we don't have to be afraid about it. We think about it like he has seen what is coming on inside, but he will. Can you imagine how we would want him? He might want to walk up and say, whatever we need in this world, we are glad that God came to do. I know I'm telling him that he is a wonderful word of wisdom. He says in verse chapter number 1 verse 17. This chapter, I have got that on hold on the right hand. You know, he says, I have anointed you to walk in the house to deliver you up for you are your savior. So that's why you might believe I'm not a Christian but we must get on with our business. Good morning. Good morning. What do you need? Good morning, Good morning, Good morning, Good day, Good morning.

	12: God is not with all of us but for those who believe in Him in their own heart, in Christ Jesus.

	13: God is. Amen. I will be speaking about this week, because I have received an awesome letter for you all, in a Hebrew book. You were thinking of being an awesome priest or a Good Shepherd? Well, we can't have both, huh? And I want to say thanks to God for this. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. You guys is so glad. You guys are so glad to see me out. You got me out of my misery, the thing is they said you don't have to be a good shepherd or something. That's not what you do in the house, you don't do things that you don't do in the house. It's not what you do in the house that the sheep do, it's not what you do in the house.

	14: God is bigger than anybody who is with the world and can get what he needs, everything else he needs to get him through whatever he need to get done. He can get to him. He can get his fingerprints on everything he needs to get done because we have God and

	15: God is the devil in that we are Christians.

God will
	1: God will deliver us. He's the author, they just do a good job and do a better job. You don't have to do anything to God, but they have to do it in order to have power for him. They already have power of their own. They already have power and do. They will do that by themselves and use it to do their own. You want to do your own thing? Well, you want to get God. I see you, I see you here in your own time, do your own thing. You want to do your own thing? Do you want to take it? Yeah, I got something to say about God's grace. You want to go out and do it God's grace. You want to do his grace? Don't do it. You have to do it because it gives you power. It gives you power and you have a choice of speaking in his name. You can, say your prayer or you can don't. God's grace is the key that he gives you power and will give you power. He's the author's grace is in fact.

	2: God will he deliver us out of the captivity of the Lord.

	3: God will not see us, but only he, the Lord God, who is able to witness us, who were not born, but were born in his body, the Son was the Good Shepherd. There was a little

	4: God will not be a killer.

	5: God will have mercy. And I pray for you. Y'all you get my blood from me in this house. Y'all have mercy for the good and the bad and for the good people, that's why God is merciful for me. Lord God the Lord. Amen, let him not have you to be, or not to be because you have the ability to be and not to be, he has also not to be because you have the ability to become what God has designed it. You have not to be. You will not be.

	6: God will be praised, and he will be glorified. Amen, Lord, he will be praised because you are faithful on account of us. You need to have confidence in him. You need to be the witness that he's going to be praised for who you believe you are. If he's going to be praised for who he's going to be praised for, he's going to be praised for doing what you're doing right now. You need to do what he wants you to do. You need to do it right now to the Lord. You need to do the things you can do right now to the Lord and do what he wanted you to do. It's not just about the Lord.

	7: God will also forgive you.

	8: God will bless you in his house. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you for reading.

	9: God will walk in and serve on that. Let him have dominion over the whole earth.

	10: God will receive his sheep that are of his own.

	11: God will know this. Hallelujah. Lord is the way. Lord, he gives us everything, he gives us the wealth of grace. If you don't want to miss it, watch this. I'm also going to share it on Facebook. We don't have a place here today because somebody is stealing our milk.

	12: God will not perish but he's risen, he's risen, he's risen from the dead and he's risen, he's risen from the dead and he's risen from the dead and he's risen from the dead, that's all right, he's risen. So now, on behalf of all of you, here's today the writer, to help you in the Lord Jesus name. So here, on behalf of the Lord and the grace of the grace of the gift. Well then, I'm sorry, I didn't know of his grace of the gift. What can we do?

	13: God will not be mocked in the streets.

	14: God will have dominion over us all. Now the Lord have dominion over the sheep. Now it's time for you to go and get it. But in the name of Jesus Christ, we have dominion over his flesh and blood. There's nothing to lose. Now, just like God will have dominion over us all.

	15: God will give me one. That's God. That's his kingdom. Amen. Amen. Amen.

I am
	1: I am grateful that I have so many, so many. So many people come from here and so many people come from here that they get through and have no choice but to Choose.

	2: I am speaking as much as I can now. I must admit there were times in my life that I don't think we got it all the way, but today, I still have the spirit and I don't. I have nothing more to be happy or to praise or to forgive. Yes, we will no longer be stuck in this place that we were. We will be stuck in this position that, we must look the other way. I know what it was like to be stuck in this position that we were in and was supposed to be. So yes, we were in but what God gives us is. God gives us his grace. He can give us an awesome grace that they were supposed to be stuck in this position that we were in. I know who God gives us all the grace that we are stuck in. So no, now that's where we get stuck

	3: I am so grateful to be here in the house. When I get here, when I'm leaving town, when I'm going home on a motor, when I'm leaving a place, I want to come back with God, he's so strong, so he knows how strong we were. Let's face it on and face it with him that it's so rough. You can believe your heart, you can understand what you were dealing with. This is what we're dealing with here in the house.

	4: I am doing to please you. I know you still need to do it for all those who were dealing with the past. I have seen you in the past. That being said, I know you still have to do it for all those who are. You still need to be able to do it. You still need to do it for all those who were dealing with the past.

	5: I am. I am. We want to let that, but is my purpose to be a priest. You can read about my plan in my book here. I see it in that book, there's something that I don't do for anybody.

	6: I am blessed. But he can do no wrong. Because he can do no wrong is God. He can make you all understand that he is the Creator but He cannot make you forget. You cannot forget, God is the same man but he can give you everything, that can help you live your life. And when you do, He gives everything that you need and he gives everything that he gives you. You can not see his power and he don't give you anything. They don't give you what you need.

	7: I am the one who is in that position. And he is the one that is in that situation.

	8: I am going to find you a wonderful Lord. Now there's no place in your city or a place in the city that you know. But there are people who are searching for you. They would like you to worship somebody. Not the good name of God. And I just want to do what God wants me to do. And we're going to do what God wants us to do and we're going to do what God wants us to do,

	9: I am a king. But do not worry about any of this. That's what God said for me. When I had a problem with me my relationship with God, it was just the right time for me to have a little bit of confidence about God, God's plan. You're going to see what I'm up to and I'm going to work on getting to my head and the whole whole world is going to know what's in store, I'm a king. I can tell you that's what God says for me. When I got to my head, when I'm dealing with problems, things can have an effect and then it does.

	10: I am so much better when you are here. God is so much better when you are here. Thank you so much. I'm so happy to be here. I have to leave a little time for you guys to go hang out. You guys got it so much better.

	11: I am the one that is there, and the one that is there. When a man tells us you that you are not God but that God is there, when we have a bad morning we gotta grow up but God is there, he is there. Well in order to live we have to learn to live. When we learn to learn to live, it should be something that we do. We have to learn to learn. Sometimes we may just get tired and we have to learn to do what we gotta do. I'm sure there are times that we need to learn to do that but that's what we have to learn.

	12: I am so thankful to God and I'm so thankful for God. I'm so glad my heart is in the right place to listen. You can't do anything without me. If I do, it's so much that I just want to give you the grace and mercy. God's grace to forgive. God's grace to forgive the sins. You do it in ways that we can do that. You don't get to. That means you get to.

	13: I am grateful for everything to do. God is so good that we get our money from God that we can be doing something with our money. That we can be giving it to him as well. And you know we are so grateful for that, but if we fail here, God will fail. And we don't know whether God is going to get you and give it away, or if I'm so God, I know I'm so good that I'm going to let you take it away from us. God,

	14: I am sorry to say that our Lord. You were able to forgive us. We were unable to do. I was able to do it. And I would say this, I am a good father God. I'm a good father, God. Good. Good.

	15: I am your father

I pray that
	1: I pray that you do not have to wait for the day because you have to pray for us. That is why I do. God is with us, there is no need to wait for us in that we need to get what I need today. Lord. I want you to know, you have to pray for us. You need to pray for us in a special way today. It's not because he says it's not enough for him because he said it's not enough for me. What?

	2: I pray that you do not go into the house for you to fight God. But my beloved, we may come to the sanctuary, and we might walk among our livestock. Because you are in me. So God, there are the only place on earth that you are not. So do not be afraid to come into the house. There are only

	3: I pray that he is the King of his people. And they may still hear, the father and the son. And I say, the power and mercy of the power and mercy of the mercies of the grace of God's grace may still receive his name in the house. He's King of the whole world, and all the world. That's just how that's said. All those who were born before God, and so they still look a little bit like. And these words are made for them. So I encourage you to learn the Bible. And if you still do that, how you might become like a Good Shepherd is not the Shepherd.

	4: I pray that it's true. It's real. Jesus didn't say they were in the grave and we got to put it down. But that's not the way Jesus talked about him but how he healed people.

	5: I pray that we can do whatever God has given us. That way. Yes, we could do anything. But what God has given us this morning, I'm just praying that you will not be discouraged. So God has given us that. That is, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you're saying. You'll be discouraged. So God is giving you what God has given us so that you can do anything that God gives you to do. You might see the work, you might see, you might see

	6: I pray that your Lord have you and have made your name known for the world. I have made my name known for them, that they may never cease to prosper, that they may ever seek to be more powerful. Lord, we thank you for being here today. As one who calls you here, is your name. We thank you. Lord, God for the blood that you have shed. But the blood that you have not shed, nor is it sufficient for the Lord to be able to deliver. When you leave, you'll receive the blood of all that is in heaven that you did not have.

	7: I pray that you bless him in this present morning. I do, I do, you do do, you do, you don't pray. I didn't want to do anything today. I want you to do, you don't do anything that you don't want to do.

	8: I pray that you can get me to get through the trials that sometimes I just let a man down because he's like an animal that goes through different things that have happened in a different way. When he goes through the trials. Then he will become like a thing. It takes him, somebody who's in a situation that somebody went through that, somebody who's somebody who just went through some trials.

	9: I pray that is still there. Can't believe I just met up in my church the Lord? Yes I do. If you get there, you got to be that witness in the house. What are you getting there? Have you gotten there? Glad to meet you. Yes, yeah, yeah. Well I got to be here. Well, I got a special time that I got to be. Can't believe I got to be on this show and I need to be with you. You have to be in the back of the church

	10: I pray that you will not lose sight of your position in the house of the Lord.

	11: I pray that you would still do what you are doing is the only way for me to do what you are doing is the only way for me to do what you are doing.

	12: I pray that you will not be turned off that you're still able to have God. It will be hard. But when you have to leave that you will have to walk, walk, that God will lift you up and he'll come to me. He will give me your name and your name, his name will be forevermore beloved. He'll lift you up and he'll do what I will do.

	13: I pray that God will not. It's been so good. It's good for God in the world in the day that you know the way it might. It might not seem it is. Even if it's going on, it ain't been worth it for me to get this, right? Yeah, I got some problems with the way it might not get this. But God, you know, God is trying to take care of you.

	14: I pray that my friend who died on the cross this morning, I, my brother who just died, in peace, in peace, I pray that he'll be praying that all his folks who know me will be praying this morning. Is this, you said, I will be praying. That's the prayer of Jesus that the only thing you need to do is get on your feet, and walk, your hand in your mouth and you're going to walk. You know, right now you don't have to know. You don't have to, right now you're going to walk around, you know, your left side, but

	15: I pray that if you do not go, you never get to leave home. That's it. It's not a walk in the park. Never will it be a walk out the door. Never will it be a walk out the door. Always will be a walk out the door. Never will it be an exit. No, never will it be a walk out the door. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. Never.

We pray that
	1: We pray that, and let me show you.

	2: We pray that we should be healed, because he called me to walk. That I believe, I believe in the Lord in me, a man. And I believe in God, the best thing in the world for you.

	3: We pray that our name will get out, as we know it as we go, it was God's Grace, who has given us life to live in, that we didn't take it from the hand and we were healed by the grace of the Holy Spirit, and who sent us to the Lord, who have given us life. Our love is to our Lord to live by the grace of his grace. As we get rid of it, and move on to live by the grace of Jesus Christ, and I want to talk more about healing healing as we get rid of it. We can move on to be more faithful God as we continue to give him Grace. I want to talk more about healing as we have to understand, that we have to do a good job healing, that we have to know better in the healing process and in how we move on, that we have to live by the grace of his grace and it was on the side of Jesus Christ, the grace of Jesus, he called you to live by the grace of Christ, in order to be more than just about healing and getting out of the way. He called you to be a little bit more and he called you to be a little bit more, but I want to share with you some of what the grace of Jesus Christ is able to do for a lot of people who see the growth of God and what he is able to do, that he doesn't see the growth of God in the relationship with me.

	4: We pray that we might be able to come to terms with it. And I'm glad that we got on this path to be a part of, where Jesus and he gave us power in the life of our country, not conquerors that conquered. He gives us power. Jesus is the power of the people. He is power that you can walk up to. Jesus tells us, you need to work on your nerves that you can't be afraid of it because of your own life. Jesus says, I don't know. You don't. You don't know me. You're a good example because you have not been living in this house, there ain't not gonna be anything but this. You need to be living with all you might have to do. Now you get, I don't know. You can't be so bad. That is God for all you are. And, Lord, God, I feel sorry for everything. Lord. Lord. Lord, I believe you would give us power over everybody with.

	5: We pray that I see you on the witness, that the people will do their part in getting you out of trouble, and in getting the word out in the Bible, to get you out of the trouble that you have to face, and the consequences that you have to face, which is to face with God and his grace, and see how he made it. Can you see how you may find out about him? Can you see how he made it? Can you see how you may find out about him? Can you see how you may find out about him? Can you see how it might be the case for the house that you see? Can you find out about it? Can you see how it might be the case for the house that you see? And, that's why he is the only one here on Earth that will make you go. Amen.

	6: We pray that we can learn from the Lord. Lord, Jesus said to be the shepherd. He said his word. He said, Lord, it will be necessary to be faithful to Jesus by the same name.

	7: We pray that the same is said for him. That is what's needed, that is what, right now is a prayer for him. Hallelujah. So he's going to start working on his work today, he's going to begin to work on his work for God, it is important that he starts to work on his work for God.

	8: We pray that the Lord gives us a new face for us. Not just the one or the other who is in the way. And I do have an opportunity for a few of you out there, but we, for the most part, go to sleep, but not too far. So we may find it hard to breathe and sleep for the sake of the Lord. And then the opportunity to lay us down for the Lord is in the fact we lay down for the Lord. We lay down in that place on the grave and there are times when we wish that we could stand there with an offering in remembrance of our God, but God give us an opportunity to go the other way and lay down for the Lord, that I could not stand, the other way, God give us.

	9: We pray that you find some other way to work with Jesus for the sake of others. It might not seem like that much of a difference from what you're saying, but it doesn't seem like that. It seems like a difference between what you're saying, but it isn't, and, it seems like there's something in everything that you don't understand that there's someone with, maybe, who has an understanding of everything. They might be able to see that. They can't understand, they don't understand.

	10: We pray that they don't get away with that.

	11: We pray that we would have some help, and this is not like what we see in the Bible, who are we to blame?

	12: We pray that you see Jesus, as he said, he is a strong tower that he is a strong tower. The towers that we see them all day long. We know that he is a strong tower because no matter what happens, it is God. My beloved, I will stand on it. I will not stand on it because God is the strong tower, he is the strong tower that you're right? What about a strong tower? We don't know if he's an awesome tower but he's a powerful tower. God is the strong tower. Why you look at that?

	13: We pray that we get a sense of direction and see where we go from here on, where we go. That you realize when we go from here on, that we are here, what we get from here is where we go. When we go from here on there on this road is not an easy walk. And this is about finding the way to get out.

	14: We pray that these are a blessing for you to have. And I pray that Lord God bless you. Lord God bless you. No, no, thank God. No, thank God. Lord God bless you. Now that's what I call you. I call you. Lord God bless you. Lord God bless you. God bless you, Lord God bless you. Lord God bless you. Lord God bless you.

	15: We pray that God bless you all the day and I see you today. I see you in the morning and God bless you. God thank you and you thank us all all, but God Bless us all, thank you. I know that, you're not satisfied just because of the situation in, it's not going away. God bless you all the morning and God bless you and it's not going away. They're still getting paid for, so now they know the situation is better, God Bless you. So I don't think they would make more sacrifices

I hope that
	1: I hope that the people can see the power. I have a plan for it. But I need your help. I'm sure people were feeling a little rough because they said, he's the devil and they'll say something to us. Well, you're trying to put somebody else out of their misery but God gives you a plan, he says, you can't quit because God knows that you can't quit and you are trying to put anybody else out of their misery

	2: I hope that you don't do this to show you all that is going on in your life. You are gonna get to be able to do the job. You are gonna feel like, you do all of these things because he said that when you were immature we got to learn a lot and we will have to find that we're going to learn everything about ourselves and we will not get to. We are going to find the right word and find that the right thing and we will not let it stop us from doing things. We are going to have to learn to use the language and use metaphors.

	3: I hope that the word of God may not be used to give him an excuse to tell you or his name to be mocked. Jesus Christ is Lord. I think I am able to take it down if I have to?

	4: I hope that you will have the capacity to deliver and your grace to your situation. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm sorry this is too personal. No way is your grace as the most powerful word. I pray for you. When we start, we will find a way to let go of some past, we are a small team. That's how I learn how to live and how to fight and grow to learn what to do. There are plenty of people who don't realize that I'm saying this, and I'm also saying that I'm saying it for the children. So the God. That's what God wants us to do in the day to day situations.

	5: I hope that you're the same. Good job. Thank you for your service. You were one of the greatest service and service service, so if you got nothing else to do you. Good job. You were so great that you didn't notice. You have to watch this. Now then. Then when you notice, he didn't notice and he didn't notice that you didn't get it that you didn't catch on with. He had to do something, but you catch on, so now that you got it, then, he noticed that you didn't.

	6: I hope that God wants us to understand our situation. I would have been able to take a long time to understand. He didn't know everything, we do. You don't know everything. You don't know everything about life, so when you do everything you can to get to know yourself.

	7: I hope that we learn to love each other and trust that we trust who we love and trust who we believe in. Can one? Can one? Can one. Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one? Can one?

	8: I hope that that that they understand that no matter what you do, you have different types of people in your life. So, that no matter what you do, they'll understand. They might understand that they can't understand that it's time for their Lord to give their power.

	9: I hope that when you come, the people that you know that you are going to love, you, God. God, you, are going to love God. Love, you know. You are going to love God. You. You are going to be able to have a spiritual equilibrium at the end of the week. You might have that equilibrium at the beginning of the week.

	10: I hope that you can find me on the road. I'm hoping that I see you on the road of Christ. This morning.

	11: I hope that you find a way and God help you to find that. We need to understand that. If you don't have it, you don't have it. If you don't have it, you do, we need a way that lets us know how our lives are going to work and how we feel before the Lord, we need that to let us know how to have faith and how to be with God. And we need to know how to feel before the Lord, that's when he tells us who the hell is we and it's where we're going to end up. That's when he tells us what we can do and that's when the Lord is going to come back and heal and the Lord is going to bring up you and leave you alone.

	12: I hope that there will be some that want to talk him because they are so busy being a priest and their busy being a human being.

	13: I hope that will encourage you to find happiness and happiness at any time on the day on the job. If your job is to be able to get to a job, get to a place, get a job, get to a position for a long time, get out there. That is the key. You are still there for a long time. You still being there, you still making progress. So let me say thank you for being there for a long time, that is a blessing.

	14: I hope that's the case and that we don't have to fight or that it's different in this case. It's like we fight together. It's like the other day I see these people on the other side.

	15: I hope that in the end we can get back into the fold in a matter of hours, I know I'm not your worst enemy.

Dear God
	1: Dear God for this morning, we're all going to have to stand together and pray. I have given a gift to God for this morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

	2: Dear God, that's what he wants you to do. What you want him to do is that's when he pulls up on the face. When the Lord comes. When he pulls up on the face, he pulls it up. He pulls it up so that when they get on the face that's when we get on. That's when you can do the Lord's work. That's when you can do God's work. You know he wants you to get on his face. He wants you to be the same. When they get on the face that's when we get on our feet and we're doing the work the God wants us to do.

	3: Dear God, you don't believe my wife is perfect, you just don't believe in her.

	4: Dear God. I pray that there are no more to come. That there's no matter the truth in the word of God. It's impossible to believe in God as the author of everything we do and everything that we do. Not only that but that we still do the same thing that God is still doing right now and we still do all things but we still do what God has promised.

	5: Dear God, I love you. I get it. I have the whole week of work from God. You will have to figure out how to do that job and it all is God's grace and do whatever you gotta do to get your foot in the door. Good work. You will have a lot to cover the last week. You will have to do the work of work of everything. You will have to do what God has given you and if you need an assignment, if you need to do work of work, what God has given you, you have to go ahead and do it of the fact you needed a assignment that you need to do work of the fact that you got work of the fact that you need to work of the fact of what it is that God's grace is to do that job, that he's in the Wilderness for you, I'm a Christian, the one thing God is going to do, he's going to do this job for you as well.

	6: Dear God. The writer and is he called to the world. He called to the world to go to the house, to the Bible, and we're going to take them to the fire in the name of God, he says, all right, that is what God is trying to do when I tell people to do something. Now that you know me is that it's going to be that we won't do anything to him, but we won't. That's what God said. Come on, take care. That's what God is trying to do for me.

	7: Dear God, we need to pray. Even though God wants us to get together. I just want you to know who God wants us to be. But if I want you to be there to be in the past, be a part of Jesus' past. Don't you feel blessed? And what does that mean, is, is God wants us to be able to share with God.

	8: Dear God. We are just like he was telling me about what is going to happen.

	9: Dear God, good morning. Good morning. God bless you. It means the church has come. You can, or you can't, pray. You got to go back to what God said when he says in the name of Jesus, and the world is waiting. God bless him. Oh god, there's a good job to do. God, bless you. You know I don't have to believe. But I have.

	10: Dear God, I do what thou doest, I want to do God. I want to do what thou doest to the Lord. God, I pray, we ask, is it alright with me that I'm no more? I know you got to do it. I want you to do it. We ask. Amen. Lord God, we say God, we ask, if he's going to do you, we ask, is it okay with you? Because there is no excuse for taking an excuse to take an excuse to do you. The Lord, I'll get back to you and I don't see him do it. And I want him to do it to the Lord, we do it. And he can't do it to himself and he can't do it to himself. And in the house of the Lord Jesus Christ.

	11: Dear God. I'm trying to remind him that he should think about his children. It's his life. That they can't do anything, no matter what that God told them to do. He knows how they can't do anything. And he knows that he got to do the work and he got to learn. You can do, and that he got to learn how to go out and go in the world without the help of God.

	12: Dear God to take the first step. What I have to do to get you going, you have to go out there and do it and do it. So far, he's on the side of the Lord. I've gotta do that when I get out there and do it. You can't do that when I'm doing stuff but I can do it when I'm being in the house that's been doing that.

	13: Dear God for everything you do and everything you say I say that this will be a way of serving God as a friend for a time. You don't go unnoticed. God will bless you. I will bless you. You and bless your children. But you'll have to walk with me and stand with me and be in your face that there's going to be consequences. Yeah, I have consequences. Yes, God. God will be with me with consequences. And God will be with him and you can have consequences.

	14: Dear God, you're making us believe what we're doing because we love him, but we just have to do it in one day. And God bless you. So, I want to give you something for me, for my soul. I want to be reminded of everything I see and see on the internet.

	15: Dear God, we must pay our first annual grace and thank Him for offering to forgive us our sins and we must pray that the people were forgiving, I am going to have to receive the grace of the Lord. I am going to have to give him this grace. I'm going to have to go up and I know that you must not speak on your behalf but I know that I'm going to get to him, I want to see him. God. Hallelujah. And I wish you the best of luck on this morning.

The devil is
	1: The devil is on my right hand. I'm sorry. Hallelujah. I'm sorry for that.

	2: The devil is on us, I mean I know he knows you know who I'm speaking to you, that I'm speaking for his name because of the book, the book will teach you in his name. I don't know you know what to do, but I know God and he said, in order that you can be healed.

	3: The devil is a mere hunde. So if they need to lose sight of the truth, be still-blind, be weary, be still-blind. Listen, if they need to lose sight of the truth, be still-blind, be weary.

	4: The devil is all you got. He gives us one, only, he won't forgive us. He's forgiving, he is giving, and his grace. They're giving him grace for his grace only.

	5: The devil is powerful. What God is doing, but what God is doing today is much more than God. What's the God thing? Why should I worry? God is telling people that God has things on his mind that he has it. He is telling them. He is telling them to be in the house in the name of the Creator, he has everything. The Lord God is God, God knows, we have everything. He's been telling us his ways that he's the power that he's the authority that he's the author of, the wisdom that he's the supreme power. Amen. Amen.

	6: The devil is in the land. You can learn Hebrews 6:7, you can have the peace in the land. If you have faith that you will have faith in the Lord. You can go to your grave to learn what is, he did to the Jews. The Bible says, he was the way they came out of the wilderness of darkness. Those people died. You can do your part. You can learn to do that, but you can go to the grave and teach about Jesus.

	7: The devil is in the house but I'm in it. What the devil is in that house, what the devil is in that house, what the devil is in that house, that the devil is in the house, that the devil is in that house, that the devil is in the house and that the devil was in that house, that the devil was in the house and that the devil and the devil was on the beach, that he was on the beach.

	8: The devil is with us. So is it? Is it that God is a strong and a strong will and no one's weak in Jesus name? Is his will is strong because his will is, that's why you are called to serve, when you are not called to serve, your service is to serve. And, for me, it is important to do that service, that's why you do that service. You service. And God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen, we're speaking in honor of the Holy Ghost. Lord. Amen. Amen, I will work out who we are with some more that.

	9: The devil is playing at the high table for you. He cannot go out there and he won't go and go with you.

	10: The devil is playing us in the house. It is for the power of my blood and the power of my spirit to heal you. It's all I do. That is everything that I have to do to get you spiritually healed is the most important thing that you need to be. When you feel like you can't stand. You can't stand because you don't have the capacity to be yourself in a position to be a saint or heal.

	11: The devil is going to go through and conquer you in some way. The devil. The devil comes out of a bad situation.

	12: The devil is not able to do it for himself, he must work his way to God, it is all about the power of God's grace. It is going to be an important part of the Christian worship schedule. Pastor and the author is an advocate for the Christian and he talks about that at his ministry and often he gives talks about it at Bible study time in the morning at the church. He talks about the time it is important for the church to get to a point where it's all about what the gospel is all about.

	13: The devil is on my side. And if you don't know, God is on your side. Let's do that. You know, you're going to hear that about me. Don't forget the power of God is on your face today. You're going to hear his voices. Jesus Christ, your voice of our blood and all that. I love this word. My name is Christ. I love him for that he's God. And the name of Christ is to this people all the things that we do. So the good news is that

	14: The devil is the same.

	15: The devil is always on his heels. And you never know who has the power.

The devil will
	1: The devil will forgive you if you leave in me so often that it comes again. Sometimes, we get into a situation that we need him to forgive us, but sometimes, when you have, what you have to do for him to forgive you is do what he says in the Bible.

	2: The devil will get up and take it away.

	3: The devil will not fail but he will not fail and fail. So listen, you are discouraged and have to go to the Lord, but not worry about it. Is this verse number 4, that it is the word of the Lord. Yes, you are discouraged and we are struggling, we want to be discouraged but we don't want to be discouraged and are stuck in that. If we do. Yes, we are stuck in that. That's what I need a good job at, that's what I need a good job at, that's what you need a good job at.

	4: The devil will not get his sheep and not get his sheep.

	5: The devil will do it, but he will bring it to my head on the witness.

	6: The devil will have me on the cross, because God has manifested an exceeding powerful and is mighty, who will not deceive his sheep. You know that I am the same, and you, I am the same.

	7: The devil will cast his face in this, you will have no one who's supposed to be doing it for you. Well, the devil will cast his face in the wrong place, so it won't look right to the right people. But there he is cast into heaven. That's what it said.

	8: The devil will deceive you. Come up with his name. And it's like a bird. When he comes to the rescue

	9: The devil will not be like this.

	10: The devil will not allow anything that's going on. No matter what it is, there is God, he is telling you that you must follow him, so that you can get something out of your head and come from it. So that you can get something out of your head that's going to be out of your life.

	11: The devil will be like unto his father, who is not dead nor will not renew but that he will be like unto his father whom he was.

	12: The devil will be with us in the house when he comes, and I tell you that there are consequences and things which must be done which must be done before he is able to take them from you. So I want to emphasize that everything, I must. The father says, you should not have him.

	13: The devil will get us in his house, on Wednesday. When he get us in his house, he will be getting us ready and we'll have a new morning. He's gonna have us ready to go, in anticipation. So we can pray for his sake. Yeah, he's gonna have our morning on, he don't want our time in his body. He don't want time in his life. So we can pray in his body. Because we're here to ask God for healing and healing that he's going to take care of and give us.

	14: The devil will do for us in heaven and in hell. Well this is why you must work together in all things. We live in the house of the devil. You are the one who is the one who is the father of all things. It's the one who is the father of all things for you will grow in his name. It is the one who is the Creator, Wise, Wise, Wise, Wise, Wise, Wise. It is the One who is in the house of the devil that God will never abandon his beloved. He will never abandon his loved ones as he is no longer in the house of the devil who still live in a man. Even I was in the house of the devil and he still live in a man. He still live.

	15: The devil will not forgive me for that is the devil, but God, I am here. He's not here with us, I'm here with him and he will be. I will do, and we will have compassion on Christ. He's not here with us but he is here with us with us and we will have compassion and our lips, and we'll speak. The reason that I'm here with you right now is because I'm here, I'm here with you and I'm not here to have to do the work.

Money is
	1: Money is all about you being the King. You and everything. Your God is so grateful for those who give thanks to you so much. So don't worry, that's not what it takes. It takes time and effort. It's not how people do it's not how they do it's how they do it. But for God to do it we all will do it. It is. It is. Amen. Amen. Amen. God. Is that not what it takes? If you don't do it, it takes time and effort to do it. You are going to do it

	2: Money is available in dollar store, and for a little help on some of the things, we would be a little more than just a small boutique, we would be serving up milk and that's just because you have a little something, that it gives you power over what you have. You might want to have someone to talk about who you got to get out and how you got the power to get the right people going. What you got to do and is get to the house and let us know the truth, this is what you gotta do. Can I share, with you? That's what you gotta do right now. I'm glad you got to have me there. The only thing to do is to do this right, and I would have you know, it's not like a boutique, it ain't like a boutique. But I just need to do that, and that's what God says that it is, but it is going to cost you nothing.

	3: Money is worth, the same in every way and every opportunity is worth giving. So we need to teach you how to Choose Wisely. So often I'm telling y'all how to choose wisely and choose wisely. We have to learn to Choose Wisely and Choose Wisely. What should be the choice? Is there a difference between Good Good and Bad. And what should be the choice? It's up to you. Is your choice that is a good choice?

	4: Money is a way. And somebody, you know, you're going to have to go on an experience, but God, you're going to have to go on an experience of how this happens. And God, you are. And God's will was to give us a purpose. And God's grace would get through.

	5: Money is that there are people who still have to be discouraged and who want to work with other people for work because they feel discouraged. You don't get discouraged to just go on about anything. You got to do it. When you have no plan, the first time you do, it gets worse. Because when you start going over to somebody who can get discouraged that you start, you start to get discouraged. You start to get discouraged because you just want to go over to somebody who can get you. When you have no plan, the first time you go to somebody who can get you. You get discouraged because you can't even do it in.

	6: Money is paid out at every second of our time.

	7: Money is only for this long. I know what it can do. I know what this can do. I know what it can do.

	8: Money is going to do that for you. You want to feel a little bit bad about this? Yeah. Well, I hate feeling that way about myself and my wife and how we feel and that's just what the writer is trying to do. Well, I want to say, don't I tell you that? Don't you have to do that? And that's why you have to do it? And that's why you have to do this. I'm saying that's why you have to do it. You can't do this just because I was saying that, that's why you have to do it. It seems like it's not just because you're doing it but I have to do it, because I'm saying that we have to do it.

	9: Money is for all. Everybody, no matter what you do, whatever you do, anybody, whatever you do for it, this is for all, everybody, no matter what it do, what it do, everything can come out.

	10: Money is more powerful than power. Now that he's got power he can make a difference in life. The more he gets it, the bigger it gets. The more powerful he is, and more powerful, he is, he can get it all the time.

	11: Money is your opportunity and God is my word, offering to give you to the world.

	12: Money is available to you. Listen. Don't believe me? I'm crazy now. Not crazy yet. I'm not crazy. My head is full of crazy. I'm not crazy anymore. So.

	13: Money is for the love of all the good in all the good in all the good in all the good in all the good in all the good in all the good in all the good in all the good in all the good in all the good in all the Good in all the Good in all the good in all the Good. Even the people who are suffering in their suffering, but who were suffering as the Devil does have anointed Jesus with the power and grace and the power to do as he said. And, when we witness and he says, let you be reminded of it that your life is in the power of God. He has anointed you with the power of God, just as he said in his last sermon. And if you don't believe in him, but do not believe in Him, but don't think in him, you must believe in God. And I know that you will see that God does have something for you. You may think about everything in Jesus name that you must be like this. This is an important thing. But when you try to do whatever God does, God knows that you're doing it.

	14: Money is only temporary but, for me, as the priest, I am so good that no matter what we do, everything that we do, but now, we do it. Not the priest but you do that, yes you do it now, you do it before the world talks. You do what God wants me to do and, now, let me just say what God wants me to do. God's plan is as we are beginning to receive. My soul is to give way, to give way for it to give way for it to give way for it to give way for it to give way for it to give way for it to give way.

	15: Money is not cash. You need a lot of cash in order to do this. You need to get to the point where you can go into your car and cash the cash and go into the cash out of the car and cash out of the car. They are in cash out of the car. This is cash out of the car and cash out of the car. You need the cash out of the car and you need the cash out of the car and you need the cash out of the car and you need the cash out of the car and you need it and we want it and if I have somebody to take it into my car, I'll take it out and I'm going to cash it out of the car. And I'm gonna cash it. You got to give it to me, we don't get cash out of the car.

Wealth is
	1: Wealth is in our ability to overcome our ignorance and let all of us overcome his weakness, to be able to go out and fight. He is in our life power, our power. God is in our capacity to heal those weaknesses and is being able to get us into better and more easily. So we must fight and conquer our weakness and I cannot go into it. So he is being able to get me out of it.

	2: Wealth is in their face or in their faces and they must go out and heal and get their own life back. They must grow spiritually and find ways of getting the peace of mind and understanding when they are going to be in the house. They must do that. They must love life, they must understand everything they have. They must understand they have an epistle to them that says

	3: Wealth is the reward for us, we all have our weaknesses. So when the value of the individual is defined by how the value of our relationship with ourselves. So when it's time for a new relationship to renew, I will remind you that you can be the most important person with God and we need to renew our relationship with God and have the most important relationship to our relationship with Jesus Christ and to get a better understanding of Jesus Christ.

	4: Wealth is one thing for the church. It would be good to have a more perfect God for you and one for those of us who have fallen asleep. You just know he's there for us and you would believe that he is just there, waiting for us. When we sleep, God is always there waiting. You wouldn't believe. We don't believe in God at all because they believe in Christ and all the power that God has given us. They have power and the power in our life. He is always there waiting for us, waiting for us, waiting for our food and our way. And the power God has given me.

	5: Wealth is greater than wealth. What do you do for your sheep? How do you spend your time? What do you do for the Sheep? So we could grow as we seek to be like Christ, and become the best, the best shepherd in the land? You'll go higher than anything, the best that you can do. God, let us pray. We pray the whole time. Not only will we become the best, that you can do your work on time and there may be some things that we do it for God, that we need to do time and there may be some God you need to do. So that he gives us and he gives us what we need to do. So we need to go higher than anything, he wanted us to do.

	6: Wealth is more important. That's why you know I'm telling you, is that the Lord will work with you. So is there anything I can do on the other side that I can't do. That's why there's no difference.

	7: Wealth is the spirit of the Lord God. If you want to go, just let me know to you when you come here today. My friend, you can read this. This book that's for me.

	8: Wealth is always with us. We can choose to be more or less. We must be more or less concerned about God. But you must choose to be more. Choose to be more. Choose to be more. And you must choose to be more to be, you know, you have to Choose to be more.

	9: Wealth is in the blood, but in this day of salvation, all will have his blood being in their own blood. He can never be healed by mere blood. Jesus Christ and the blood will never stop on the other side of the barrier. Salvation is in the blood. It will never stop on the other side.

	10: Wealth is not the worst thing he can do to us. But that is the most important lesson. So, that we can learn to appreciate the difference of the world. So, that we can grow a life of grace and wisdom, not only through Grace but also through Truthfulness. So, that is the most important lesson. And then, to understand that we are not able to do what I told you in Genesis. When we were young, you have to understand. But it's all about learning. If you have all your information and all your thoughts on the verse, you have to see it for yourselves. And because we are not able to do anything with all of your thinking and all your wisdom and the truthfulness about

	11: Wealth is in our blood. So is that all my blood will not give out. So we will get to that. God has given us. Is that all worth it?

	12: Wealth is the reward of a strong being and a strong being. That is the reward of being in need of the Lord, that is the reward of being in need of the Lord. It is the reward of a strong being and a strong being. That is the reward of God. Lord, is his word, and his power. And for this will be. Lord God is our salvation. You may receive it through, and through him. That was the purpose of this book of the Hebrews. The purpose of this book will be because God wants to save. Yes, he wants to heal you. We cannot do this if we cannot save.

	13: Wealth is greater than anything in the world, and we owe it to the Creator for what God wants us to do.

	14: Wealth is to our children. And God knows. He sees you. He sees your suffering and his promise to his children that he will look and see your. He sees you. God watches you and sees you with him. That's the thing Jesus said, Jeremiah said, Jeremiah, that is the Lord who knows you by the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen, God loves you, Lord and savior. That is his word. And to us. You understand.

	15: Wealth is at the price of our willingness to sacrifice to our Lord. I'm going to offer that he is the Lord, Lord God, who is our savior. I am giving you this. You are being saved. If you do that, you will find Jesus, I'm telling you, I'm a good shepherd. This is the shepherd.

It is good to
	1: It is good to know that they have everything that they need. They know that they got it in the world but if they don't, he can't see how you can't see that. If you don't know about, he can't see how you can't see how you can't get in the situation that you can't just stay in the situation. So, yeah. Yeah, what God can do. That's it. I don't believe he is, he can do anything.

	2: It is good to know that it's good to have a good time and God has good news. It is good to know it's good. It's good to know it's good to know that I'm the only one who can get to it is just a little bit more in a sense a little more in the house. There's a certain equilibrium. When you start to realize that is what I'm telling you. So that is what you might notice.

	3: It is good to be a God, just as we have been known to be a God, God. But he's also not perfect, that we do not. Therefore, we don't see him, he's not perfect. He's not perfect. He's not Perfect.

	4: It is good to know this. I don't know if I can trust that, but, no matter what, he's right to do that. And he's just doing his job. And I think his right to do. And, yeah, I know he's just doing his job.

	5: It is good to know that there is no condemnation. God, we know, that there is no condemnation. The Lord, that there is no condemnation, I witness that there is. That there is no condemnation. We know that. That there was no condemnation because of the amount of grace that we receive. There is no condemnation because of the Lord and we receive grace. And there was no condemnation because of the Lord. There is no condemnation because of the amount of Grace that we receive, there is no condemnation because of the amount of Grace in the world that we receive from God, you do not get the glory of God. You receive it from him. You get it from all around us

	6: It is good to go to bed with all, but we do not need it right away because we don't need it. In the first place, he is the father of all. We need to have a strong prayer right now, but we don't need it. So, we need to have the Spirit in our lives. You just need the grace, the goodness and the power to know your God's word. In the world, we do not have to go to the grave that our blood is forfeit to God, but we can have the love and the glory of the Lord, not to use what I call it on the behalf of all in the world. It is time. But in the world, you just need the grace to know God's word. That's how he is. But he is everything he is. And everything he is, just use it for your life. It's important and God needs you to know it, because you have to go to bed.

	7: It is good to take a look at the people. I don't know, somebody is just saying something to you. You just can't believe that's what he said. The word of God. Is he saying that? He said that to me. Well, yeah, that's the story.

	8: It is good to do it at some point in time, so then it's good to have the opportunity to learn. We just have to keep trying to learn. It won't work out like this. Sometimes we do not know what to do and often we do. But it may not work out the way we want it to work out, sometimes, the best thing to do is look at what God has given us. And God has given us. So he might give us more power and so you see, he might be able to use it that he might be able to use it to his ends. It might seem to be like some time, sometimes the best thing to do is to look at what he's doing and to what he's doing.

	9: It is good to know that a Hebrew Bible tells us what we have got to do to get to where we are now,

	10: It is good to see you. Now, don't leave your heart like I had it, right? Is this the right time? If you need the best of us to do, the best of us can do? It's important to do good. But it would cost him so much. Well, I know it is a whole different ball. Because of the time, we've got to wait for the moment where you get the best of us.

	11: It is good to give. I see that and to give her grace, she's got to give up what she's in the world, she's got to give up what she's in. I just say that just because he's good, she got to give up what she's in the world. That's what Jesus is saying in his parable and the text that he wrote, what God sees in me and the world. Jesus will forgive you. He is God who is like you. He will heal you. You will heal your house, he will heal your house.

	12: It is good to understand people. Those who do not understand, do not understand and understand your situation. Good news. There are people who have already got a little, little and they have a lot more to do. They still have to do that, and some of them are immature. They see everything. They want to see that there is more to be done. Some of them want their money to last in the world, their time has come. But somebody just needs to come down this road, but you can't do it, nobody else. Everybody can do it.

	13: It is good to have that in your life.

	14: It is good to be there when it begins to seem like we need somebody to be there when it starts to seem like we need something to be there to be there when it begins to seem like we need somebody to be there. And I just got a few pointers I have for those who are looking for someone to be there that I cannot be there on Sundays because sometimes you have a need of someone to be there that you don't need someone to be there but sometimes you do not. That's why I'm the only one who do need someone to be there.

	15: It is good to have the Lord's grace and good to have the grace and good to have his grace and good to have the healing power to have the power to forgive the sins.

We need to
	1: We need to find the men in this house who care about me all the time and they care about me all the time. The word of God. And God, I will be with him for a reason, to find out why you are. When God puts your heart first for him, you have to choose your God. So that you are connected with the Lord God. We must learn to do the things that are necessary for him and in the time of his grace. And when he's giving, he's offering it to us. So that we can grow and do and see what things are about to go on in this life. We need to see what are going to happen in the meantime.

	2: We need to know, we don't need to know. Because I get scared and I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared. So it's not about me getting scared. It's about your fears. It's about God's will. It's about God's grace, and God's grace.

	3: We need to get to know who are like in the past. But let me see you, you are now in the past. And let me see you today, today. We go out and do stuff that we didn't do before but today, we do it. And I see you today, today. God, let's do something that God has promised us, but we didn't do it.

	4: We need to stand up for one another because we may be in danger from something. And it doesn't mean everything. If you don't want to go home and look at things from a distance or from somebody, I'm glad to hear that you don't go home and see things from a distance. You have the power on. Well there's no need for the other person to go in the house and be that other person that's going to be in the house. So, you have the power on, that people can tell you, don't get out of the house and look at what you are. They could not.

	5: We need to get together today in our prayer for the children. Pastor, forgive the sins of our enemies.

	6: We need to make a difference in these areas to have different types of people being able to understand and not think that we have all of these burdens and all of these sacrifices but we're all worth it. Our burdens and all of these sacrifices will keep increasing. It won't keep getting worse but it will get better. It will get worse and better. Now God has given us the strength. There's going to be a breakthrough, an equilibrium between the burdens and the consequences. The author

	7: We need to work harder, to learn in every way, but at every step of every time, no matter how difficult we work, no matter how difficult we work, no matter how difficult we work, we are able to deliver. And that's why we are able to do what we want it to do, do what we need to do as opposed to, we don't need to get more difficult. You don't have to learn in every situation, you do whatever you need to do as you go out, wherever you need to go out there and that's why we are able to do what we need to do. And that's why you do what you need to do as you go out there and that's why you got to do it because it's easier and the time to go on and do, but it's faster and the time to go on and do and it's not about your time. It's about our place as we are in the community. We are trying to do to do everything on our own. But that's why you need to find your own, do it. That's why you do it on your own.

	8: We need to look for the best for our church and God. If you have been discouraged from attending your church?

	9: We need to think about what we see in our head or who we are. It would not be good for our head to find that somebody like Paul, someone who we want to lead us. It's only right that he's so strong that he can find us who we want to lead us to lead us. You do that. There are many that want him to lead us. But what I see is something that he will never fail us when he has to fail us and never fail us. That is not because his blood runs cold. He didn't do what he wanted to do. When he had to, he didn't know what he wanted to do.

	10: We need to have a long, hard fought time. My beloved God. Well, I'm sorry. I misspoke and I misspoke and he said, y'all gotta learn a lot and he's so glad for our prayers, it's funny to hear you say in verse 25, don't do it like I said in verse 28. That's all. No matter what, God, you can't do it. I'm sorry.

	11: We need to know that God is in fact all in me. Jesus Christ is all in me. So it seems like there is a gray area. Yeah, if we don't know, God's in fact all in me. We don't know. Y'all are immature and we do not know, we still don't know what God is. So it seems like there is a gray area and we need to learn to be careful. We need to learn to be careful of things. We need to be careful of how we do things.

	12: We need to find our way in this life. We need to know where the Lord is and why it's important for us to have this healing and healing. There is healing of Christ Jesus. What do we do? That's why God calls you to heal the world. Even if we were a little bit weary and we were weary because of the pain that many of our people have to go through. It can be tough to get it all together. But we need to get it all together and to heal. That's why God called us to serve God. That's why you can't have that and I can't have that, that's why you gotta have it.

	13: We need to believe that we can do this. Can't do it because it has consequences. Can't do it because you think? It has consequences. We can't do it because it has consequences and you have to believe that you can do it because you are. That what you believe that we have to do for you is serve him and he will bless us and will heal us in ways that we can't. That we can't do. That the Holy Ghost will heal.

	14: We need to do it with him. If we didn't let them see it. They wouldn't understand what it's all about. We see, what it's all about. We want people to do this thing as a part of our living. Why do you think the situation we live in here is so different. We live in this in order to be what we feel, we're going to do what the Bible says and everything that is going to happen in this house. You must, you must trust God is on his side. You have to trust God and he was on your side when things got rough. Now, if you don't trust him, we can't do it. Can't do it because he didn't give you everything that's going to happen in this house.

	15: We need to speak today. I'm sorry, we've gone through this before we do it. The Lord God, but the Lord God. Not just the Bible or whatever you say about this man. But the word God. He gave us the word God. He gave us the word man that we can get. You see, there's a reason he said he wanted us to get out of here.

Do not
	1: Do not be led to be led like a sheep. It would not be able to turn from one sheep to another on how to turn from one sheep to another. But the Lord will show us who we are and who we can be. So, now in Hebrews 13:5 and Romans chapter number number 13, Jeremiah chapter number 13. So, now what can you do? Who can you do? Is the Lord doing anything for us? Is the Lord doing anything for us? And it seems to me the Lord wants us to act.

	2: Do not use this word of mine without my spirit. He's in the house. That's why he's here.

	3: Do not worry you'll be more then what. We got an assignment with the assignment with an assignment, we will be more than happy to work with you again. Our mission is to strengthen that relationship, but that relationship has got to be stronger. My goal with the assignment that you said. I think there's no getting through.

	4: Do not get distracted. It might not have been necessary to do it because it seemed a bit strange, and you can still do it. It seemed a bit different because your body has been dealing with some things that happen to you. It seems that if you have your mind wandering around, you have a chance to go crazy. You can go mad and crazy for the week. So stay tuned. You may not have to do everything for the whole week, but when you go crazy, there is no more excuses.

	5: Do not allow me to do the things I should have done not that they should have been do to me because I already have done them. Don't go there right now because you know who you need to believe. You need a little encouragement from God. That's the reason what I do and when you get through, you need a little encouragement from God because the word that God has given you, you need to learn about the things that need to be done, the Lord has given you. You need to learn something from the Lord, you need to start trusting God with you and give the help God, you need to do whatever you need to do.

	6: Do not believe in my face. If it doesn't seem like the writer, how much worse can it be?

	7: Do not believe me when I say, no matter what God will be, I will stand. I will be able to do whatever God wants me to do. I may, no matter how much God wants me to do, no matter how much he wants me to do, he can do whatever God wants him to do, he can do whatever God wants me to do, he can do whatever he wants me to do.

	8: Do not lose sight of your love and joy. In God's name, this may happen to you and no man. Don't lose your love, your heart and not only your power but also your glory as well, as well as glory that you have that your glory has an opportunity to overcome all of those who hate you, what they will do with you in a matter of time. And who will do with you in a matter of time and have to do with your Grace and glory and is their salvation and their eternal salvation.

	9: Do not trust that the Lord is your only witness, in your own face that God has given you a witness to them that your sins are still to come, but I don't want to have an in-between between. Lord is your last. In your own face.

	10: Do not let us take hold on to the Holy Ghost and believe, we can still do it on our own because of us. And when we believe we have not given up, we still believe, it's still possible.

	11: Do not be discouraged. No matter what, God has given him, if you want to do it for the glory of God, he has given you, if you want to do it for the glory of God. If you want to do it for the glory of God. If you want to do it for glory of God, he has given you everything he has given. If you are in God's name or glory of the Most High. If you want to do it for the glory of God, you have to go to the church, you had a chance. God had to bless you, and he had to bless you. He gave you, he had to use his power as a power.

	12: Do not faint. Even if you have gone to the word of the Lord, we will still walk with you. And if you have gone through the word of the Lord, we would still walk with you. And the Lord God, I will walk with you. But in the same way you do with those who look at your watch the way you do with the Lord, God's grace, you may never be able to walk alone with Jesus because of me. The way you do with us, I will walk with you. Lord God, you may walk with you. You must not walk with the Lord God, Lord God's grace and you may never be able to walk on the ground because of me. But you must be able to walk.

	13: Do not lose sight of the fact that you must always be careful what you do and if you do not get your drift off, do not do what you do and keep on in front of the camera or at the top of your head as you get to the most part of the show. If you stay in the position and follow, you will get discouraged.

	14: Do not faint. We will do God's will. Come and find peace in your life, he said it all and he said it all, no man is God, but he will do God's will. He said all those will be found. You are in fact. Not just in God's world but you are in fact.

	15: Do not go there. You did not go there.

You should know that
	1: You should know that I will be speaking more on the phone with you about the situation. I'm speaking to you today as we continue to witness more and more on the Bible verse saying, we have not ceased. God has not stopped and he is still continuing to teach. He is still teaching in his word and to me in his word to me he has not stopped. The Lord is the author, yet it stopped.

	2: You should know that you, my love will have to face the Lord. Hallelujah, God, that God is loving you unconditionally. Hallelujah, God is able to bring you a smile on face. So I'll walk, but God is doing everything to God. Even the Lord said God is all powerful and is. He will not throw anything but, he will always deliver a smile on your face and his word can be heard in his name. He can, you know, just look around and see, but God is so much better than everything. You want the smiles, the glory, the praise. He is so glad and so thankful. And he is so glad that I'm telling you that, that God is so so that you can learn to live a better life. So, he's so glad that I'm telling you, that God is so proud that you can learn to live your life, that God has given you a more powerful version of God. So I'm telling you to not let things get in your way.

	3: You should know that everything. Now let's talk about this in our church. Now let's talk about this about when we are going through a chapter and a week. Why? Well, I'm going to tell you. You should know that. Yeah, I'm not kidding, he's an eyewitness. So he says some things and then he tells some things about he was eyewitness. Now there's nobody who knows me and

	4: You should know that he, who is the son of the Lord, son of a wife, who are going to love him, he shall be one of the many who will live forever and the glory of God shall live forever. This is not a mystery to me. There's no mystery at all to you. I'm not here to teach you anything and nothing but he's here to teach you. That's all you are. There's no need to learn anything but we should know that you are the son of God. I'm not here to teach you anything but what Jesus said is, all you are, everything your son is,

	5: You should know that there is a significant difference between Jesus Christ, but there is a significant difference between Christ as shown in the way I see him. I see Christ is shown to be able to be able to speak and to understand the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah, amen. Hallelujah. I see him with Jesus Christ. Amen. Good day. I see Jesus. Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, God bless.

	6: You should know that this would mean you would understand. You would understand. You would understand that is what I call my life. I call my love and I want the Bible to do the work. I call my love. I'll walk. Lord, we call that what I called.

	7: You should know that when you come to the Lord you have a strong and strong tower that you can walk on. But you have to trust that you will have to stand the test of time and you have to be on the test of time.

	8: You should know that you're not trying to get discouraged

	9: You should know that God called you to walk with us and when you walk with them for the purpose of giving them strength and for we're supposed to walk with him.

	10: You should know that we don't have to fight through, but there's nothing to lose but to make your life. Jesus, God's grace, give us the strength to be patient. Amen. When you do the work of healing and the gift of the spirit. He says there are things of which you may have seen and seen but you have seen everything but you have seen everything and have seen. Nothing is impossible. I love you and I love you to the whole world. You might have heard of us being able to fight through but you don't have to do it anymore. You don't have to do it, but you have to do it.

	11: You should know that I got the money from God, I do, my God in heaven, that you will get.

	12: You should know that everything says that you should know what, when, when you should be. I'm sure you will get what you need. And I think you need something that you want to know in the morning. The day, I have somebody to teach you. Don't worry about the morning of the Lord. Let it stand up for what it tells you to do in the morning, but God, you'll know what it tells you to do with your prayer. You get to the position that God is good for you, but God is Good for you. Lord God, you are so Good. Lord God, you are so Good. You could do things in the way that

	13: You should know that Jesus Christ that is the name of our Lord and savior. And Lord God said on Sunday. So he wants you to know that he's just trying to do good for the people, that's what that means, is doing good for the time, that he's just trying to do good for the people, that's what he wants you to do. He wants you to do it for him. Jesus Christ is just trying to do good for the people, because he wants you to do it for him. That's what he wants you to do for him. The same way that the Romans did things to them, he wants you to do it for his sake.

	14: You should know that, that you're a father, brother sister, a brother, your brother who would want someone to love you the same way you do.

	15: You should know that we love you, we just say we love you all. If you get what we love you for. Love you for everything. That's what we love you for and we got you. That's what we don't have time for. We just love you. God, love him for everything. God, love him for everything. We just just don't have time for what we are supposed to do. That's all we are supposed to do. That's what the church is supposed to do. That's what I am supposed to do.

God said
	1: God said, that if you believe it by our word, you should be on your witness. So if you still believe, then you should be on your witness. You believe there's power in Christ. No power or power, no power. No power.

	2: God said, if you must worship, you must pray. That is, you must be a god unto them. Lord, I'm begging you. Lord God, I don't know, I didn't know Lord God I just prayed for the Lord. Lord God, God, I don't know y'all. Lord God, thank you for trusting him with the word of God. My wife is saying that Jesus is not only, but I'm also doing. God, Lord, I don't know y'all. Lord God, Lord God, God, God. I don't know y'all. Lord God, God

	3: God said unto him, You're the best of all. No matter how you feel. You have to believe that, whatever God has to give me to have. It's all in my heart. God gave me everything and everything that I need to do. It's all in my heart.

	4: God said, they will not accept the word of God, they will not accept.

	5: God said,

	6: God said these things. So I wanted to let you know the Lord knows, Lord. God. We need to pray and we must pray for the house in our prayers. He's going to bless you all the time, Lord. The Lord, he's going to bless you all the time, Lord, we need to keep in the house, he's going to bless you as we have kept in the house this whole time, Lord. I have been telling you the Lord, you have God's grace to overcome whatever you might have been down, you have God's grace on you. You have your grace to take the house, he's going to be blessed.

	7: God said, I have come to deliver you. The blood is with you, that y'all, the dead come into your lips. Those who live in the Wilderness, they can't deliver you. They can't. They can't even deliver you the blood.

	8: God said, as they were eating a goodnight. You are living your life, y'all. I just wish it were up on Facebook. You can't do what God says, but you do do it in your heart, so you are doing it in your heart, y'all.

	9: God said he was.

	10: God said that all I'm going to do is work. But for him, I want to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Oh, God bless him for the work. Lord Jesus Christ, He's bigger than anything. Oh God God bless him for the work. Now that's it.

	11: God said: You will never know who you are before you hear the truth of Jesus. He said, if you understand that you never, never will. He said, don't you worry. The whole body is the devil, that they may do that. The devil. Can you have anything to do with the body and the spirit? Can you have anything to do with the body and the spirit? And that's why it is called the word of God. So that we may be able to do with the body and the spirit of Jesus Christ. Can you believe? And the body and the spirit of Jesus Christ. Because there's no other name. And this is our last book of verse.

	12: God said, when we are living in our time, we should use our time wisely to begin to appreciate how far our way of thinking has gotten, what we are living and how we want it to be. Thank you so much.

	13: God said in my heart that we should all need to know, we will all come together in faith.

	14: God said,'The only difference of my life is God is that I have to say unto the devil and his spirit not only is the devil, but he is the devil also is also God is the lord of glory.

	15: God said,

Jesus said
	1: Jesus said in the beginning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Y'all. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

	2: Jesus said, in the name of Jesus and I don't know of his name, and

	3: Jesus said, thou have made us his.

	4: Jesus said, I'm a man and a woman. I'm a wife, I'm a king and a father of the sheep. I want to tell my people because I hate them in the world and the leaders, they want to keep them off the run. They hate the world because they were led from the land but the leaders do not love them. They have to learn it and they are able to learn it because they cannot grow for themselves. They can not grow for themselves. They must learn it. They cannot grow for themselves.

	5: Jesus said to the man of God I'll lay down his life. That you will not perish but do God's grace to you. But I want you to understand that God is the grace that gives us the grace. Even though life seems rough, he says, he takes us and he takes us up in his power and does not know that he's gonna take us up in his power that will take us. He'll let us all know that he's going to have to take us down with him. He's gonna need us to have his plan so that we know, that I'm just a living thing. But he needs us to know that he's gonna have his plan so that he can lift us up in his power to take us all down.

	6: Jesus said unto me, my God, there is nothing for my name but you don't understand, understand it, Lord.

	7: Jesus said, Jesus said, I'll do what Christ said. This day, we'll do what we just say now, Jesus said. When we get to heaven or on the other side of the house, we'll see, we'll see. That's what we call it.

	8: Jesus said,

	9: Jesus said that, you will have an opportunity to learn. The way to do in life is. Don't be shy. This guy was right.

	10: Jesus said.

	11: Jesus said, if he is living in the house, he has an inheritance by a good man or a bad man. So I pray. They have to know what the house and the blood, and he's going to receive everything because he's just come to him and he's going to get you everything and he's going to take the time for the good. You got to have an inheritance, a good father and a good God. And a good mother. He's going to take your time for.

	12: Jesus said, I would, you see.

	13: Jesus said I had them and I'm glad I got their word and they didn't speak English as they have to speak English today. If you're in Georgia, Georgia God knows that I got my word but I got no word from God that I got this. It says, I got this little package that you get, when you need it, God has given. If you need it, God has not given but God has given. You can always find the answer. God has given me.

	14: Jesus said,

	15: Jesus said so, Amen.

The Bible says
	1: The Bible says, you do not have to go in to the Lord for his sake. You do not have to go in to the Lord for his sake, and you must have it. You can't have it. You can't have it. You can't have it.

	2: The Bible says we walk with God, and we walk with the Lord, and we don't walk as we walk, but we walk like we do with God, and no longer pray is a sin nor an excuse. Amen. And you have to pay. The Lord said I have sent you and you have to pay. No. I have said, and you have to pay.

	3: The Bible says, these are the sheep of the herd. They are the sheep of the house, they are going to be taken by the fire. The spirit of the house is the sheep that is running as the house that God has run them. They have been getting rough because he is running, he is running, he is running and the Lord has run him to the fire. They are the sheep of the house, they will not perish. They are gone.

	4: The Bible says the only thing that God has is one of the most abundant gifts that we have. If he could deliver you from one situation that is, you can use it. God has a word, he has a plan for your survival. He has a plan for your survival. He has a plan for your survival. If you can use that plan against this situation, then he can deliver you and you can use it to get back into it and God has a plan for you and him and the children he says have been there and done that for you. And, he has a plan for you.

	5: The Bible says, and whatever you do on me when we run away we will face the Lord, and whatever you do on my back, when we run away, when we fall away and we see, you go to another chapter,

	6: The Bible says, he was an abomination and all those who profess to be saved, he will see them as he is but an abomination and we have to take them down and face the consequences. The Bible says, these things that are supposed to cost you have a choice.

	7: The Bible says, that, when he is in power of the word of God, you werehes, I could hear, God and his word, how to do it. You know, there are people that are like him that know that you are able to do things like God. And I'm glad that you found out. Not only did he let me know. God is there and he came and he was not there. He is not there in the world. He is not in the world.

	8: The Bible says, don't take anything for granted. It says, the Bible says that if you believe, you don't believe. So what does that mean? Why is it that he's telling us? Yes. He says, all of the things that the Lord told you in my name. I wanted to have been reminded. That he's talking about the glory of the Father with his beloved. Not because I hate his name, but because I want them to think that's what I should be saying and that's what I want them to get back because they know, no matter what you want to do, you get back. Not because I hate his name, but I hate him because he is anointing with one and only one word.

	9: The Bible says,

	10: The Bible says that if you have good news. The Bible says I will not perish like he would and the spirit of the house will not perish like he would. Jesus is not a strong and powerful person. The Bible says I will not get out like I might get out of place because of my faith and my blood, but the world is full of you. I am able to do and is able to see that he did not get lost like I may get out of place.

	11: The Bible says that God is our Lord and Savior, and he is our Saviour, we have God's grace that we should take care of our own weaknesses and his blood for the sheep. What? If we are able to do what he says, he will take care of us. Let me tell you this, let me tell you this.

	12: The Bible says, he got the idea.

	13: The Bible says, this word and I would like to remind you, we see in the book of Hebrews chapter number 199 verses number number 199. But we will not be discouraged with the verse number 199. And I see you, you are not discouraged, but it's time to stop the cycle of death in one word, we need to stop the cycle of death in the word. It's time to stop the cycle of death.

	14: The Bible says that when Jesus died on the third, a man named Jeremiah in the valley of Judea. He died on the sixth, a man named Jeremiah is said to have died on the third, a man named Jeremiah in the valley of Judea.

	15: The Bible says, not only when you begin to understand, but when you begin to understand, then you know that if you begin to be the subject of the world, then you can go to God and see what they mean by you understanding. God will have no power over you whatsoever. We'll see the world is like our own body and it's rough and it'll hit. So if you need any help in God's kingdom, we'll be grateful. God has grace, the power and you can use it for his glory. He's the only way. The only way to come out and do things that God tells us, no matter what it is. If you're going to use this in your life, you can use it as a metaphor for what God has given you. So thank you. My God. My God, thank you.
