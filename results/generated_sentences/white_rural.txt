God is
	1: God is the one. I pray that you can live with the one and love your brother, be with us. The Lord is working for you. Revival is the only one that you have to live with and I pray that you can build that kingdom. Because of that, you are the one that you are. And the only one that's the One.

	2: God is with us. He's with us and he's with us, and he's with us and we're going to try to see if he'll get us into trouble in the next five years.

	3: God is going to take a stick and pull it up, but you're going to show me something, a little bit of something that's been neglected since his days of service. He was still a young man trying to come back into his place. This time, God was trying to bring him back. Now it's time to take a stick and pull it up. God's gonna take a stick and pull it up.

	4: God is with us today. We believe that there's great power that the Lord has that's been working with us for 25, 28 years. We believe that. We pray that you'll work with us for 25, 29 years. Thank you for being with us today. Amen.

	5: God is a god but the world is just a man. They have no time to turn. I'm not going to take this one back or anything. I'm going to turn off his television in the middle of the night and preach all the time and you know what? They don't have time to turn.

	6: God is my beloved father, who is my beloved, who is my Lord, who is my beloved. I am in the midst of sorrow, joy, anxiety and distress when I get up. I can't find a word to say, he's doing me wrong. But that's okay for the most part. But as an important person in the church and to say the word, he's a disciplinarian and his kids have different minds. He's not disciplinarian. They have different habits with school, their jobs. Like, they're learning different habits.

	7: God is the firstborn of God. And for all you know, there's an idolatry.

	8: God is our creator. But for those who are not yet disciples of God. Father, send me a witness. I want you to show you that God was not satisfied with what she promised you. But God has chosen. Father, I want to deliver you that he has chosen that he would deliver you. He will deliver you from this world and make it his own. I want you to show me a piece of paper, an award on your honor.

	9: God is a spirit of war, that's what he's fighting against God and he's in there fighting the devil in my life fighting him, but he doesn't even have to be at a party and he says something because he's going to die fighting God. So that's why I am fighting God. But it's why I'm doing that, it's not only because that's what he's fighting against God and he's in my life fighting him, but he's in the habit of doing this, he's just not interested in it or you're interested in that, we have to go along with that. We're just living with this. It's not for one day, man. They

	10: God is the father of many nations.

	11: God is the one that God chooses him over us? God chose him over us but God chosen him over us. He will carry us by this leg in righteousness and his chosen ones, carrying them by this side in obedience.

	12: God is like it. There's got to be a way to say, if you have a problem with something that is so, um, I can take care of it. It's kind of an issue of course. And we've got to say, let's put our hands together as one. But we get to the point, you don't see people going to be saying, they don't want somebody to do this, but God. God is kind of a big part of it. I am so thankful for it's going to make that happen in this region. And God is the most awesome God. We're just thankful we have a spot in this region of all these states that we're at, that he's going to show us what God is going to do. This is the greatest part of the world. He's going to show us what God is going to work for this part of the world. That's what I believe.

	13: God is a Living, and it's a living spirit. He is a living. He's a very, very well-mannered, he's a very mobile person.

	14: God is this person's most prized possession. He's a great man and great leader. He's going to have the power to lead people around the world in some very perilous times. This is not our time. We need to be ready with hope. There's hope. And if the world changes we will change. It will be a time of turmoil.

	15: God is the only one who is worthy to serve you, amen. And so, we have a time now in our lives when we need to find a new way that God works and shows that He has given a man in this case, but when we see that we have an opportunity to find a new way to serve him, then God's been telling us that there are two things that we should strive for in this week. He said

God will
	1: God will ask for your prayer at his tent and we pray for him. You know, we need your prayers. We need your prayers. And it gets you excited and that's why we pray every night of the week because our lives are getting back together and getting that back in the community together and how we're gonna heal, where we can heal, where we can come together. And how can you go with something like that? So much can happen in our life with your testimony.

	2: God will not deliver for you. He will not deliver for you. He will not deliver for you.

	3: God will answer and God will send you out of this world.

	4: God will do with you as he's going to do with you as he's going to do with you.

	5: God will be exceedingly good. The Church is a living God. Amen.

	6: God will look past my problems.

	7: God will be called to you from the Father. Amen.

	8: God will not make you worry.

	9: God will send it. You can keep the people and you can keep the people. Jesus, you don't know anybody on Earth that gets hurt, that's what it's like to be in the middle of it because the things that people go through and they see people hurt in the middle of it and they just try to turn this into a holy fire where they turn it into a disaster. It's like a fire that just goes straight to the surface of our planet. So what that does is it starts cooling. And all the

	10: God will be in our lives as he was, that what we experience as an alien from our own place has a lot to do with that alien. And God said in Genesis 11, "The blood of this Earth, it will pass through time and it will come back and I'll bless God on that day in my life where I will be, bless me on that day of my life that I will come back and I'll live with God.

	11: God will look at the blood of the sheep on the cross and then he says, this will be your way. We will pray at the same time, I pray for your family, we want to pray for your prayer, we pray for their family. We are trying to make you a man. And you are not a man. No woman can tell him that he has anointing in her womb. So when he says, we pray,

	12: God will bless you with the kingdom of God. We were commanded by the Lord's people to worship you that you will be greatly diminished, but we have been commanded by Christ that we will be greatly diminished in size as we go through the difficulties we faced before. You will not look the other way as the kingdom of God will bless us. So thank God for that.

	13: God will not see a day where you don't make the promises that God can't make. He's not going to see a world where he couldn't make them, but he can see that you. You're going to find God and that he's just going to make you believe, he's going to make you believe, he's going to make you believe.

	14: God will make you as good as they had ever had. He said. This was all about God. You're good as you were. It will serve you as we have. We can make a difference. You've got to go. You can be in this fight like some kind of comedian. We've got to go.

	15: God will answer.

I am
	1: I am glad you're doing this for me. You're making us the first one in Jesus name, that's what they want to make us. Thank you so much. I love that you're a great man. Now, thank you so much. Thank you so much.

	2: I am not going to stop preaching my people this week. If I have been preaching your people, let's get to it. I'm not doing God speaking here because I am trying to preach my people. I don't have any money to go buy a Bible and the preacher's the Lord but I can only go pray. But I can see the promises and this week is going to make it happen. God knows, we may have some problems but when we are ready, God looks at me and he says, Lord, that's what we want. Like, this week. He'll get a little bigger. He'll get a little bigger. The crowds and it'll turn and they're gonna laugh at us.

	3: I am an excellent father.

	4: I am still a Godly person and my heart still turns to my head and I said to you, I have no idea how many of you still love me that much, he said it's just not going to change your mind. You know, just as a pilgrim when you're at that place and people ask for you. That's what this church means. We don't know how many of you can tell us, we can't remember when, or how many people have been praying, when they said, how many of you know we've got to get the rest of the way in a little bit.

	5: I am going to see you again. You may come back, and show up again on the Sabbath, and they'll all have their Sabbath. You might be glad, we got to see the Messiah again. Amen.

	6: I am here at the moment when the Holy Spirit will answer for me. I am reminded that he is going to be the first to speak of Jesus, what are the consequences of that? I want to pray to him that what you've gone through can be healed. May the Spirit be with you in the future, but what you have gone through can be healed. There are times I'm going to come through and I'm going to pray to you that he'll be healed. And then, as long as he's been healed, the Holy Spirit will be with you and he'll be healed.

	7: I am.

	8: I am thankful to you. We need to ask, if you'd like to know me, would you go talk about a person that we're trying to build a relationship with and that's not a matter of any relationship. We need to work with you, the person that we're trying to build a relationship with is one who is excited about going out and that needs to be our buddy.

	9: I am all God. I have the devil in me, I have a plan in the midst of the kingdom of heaven to crush everything. He has no intention or intention to hurt or kill me when he's going to crush everything into smithereens because he said it and he said something and I said it and he said it and I said it. I'm sure there are times God takes care of the people but he needs to be careful that they get all the information and he can know where they are going. But for me, if it's too hard to talk to God, pray, read scripture and see if he can keep their promises.

	10: I am glad to be able to help out the community.

	11: I am very open with how I handle this, in your life, I'm so open and so excited to hear of you. A young guy is going to be attracted to me that I know and love. I'm going to be really open and I'm really excited about him. I can't believe what I'm going to do. I am going to be really open and really young and I'm excited about that. And I want to go out on my own and try to build around me. I want to make sure that he's still young. He's still young but he's still going to be capable.

	12: I am so excited and excited about this. We thank God for this opportunity. It reminds me of the times I've spent praying for my daughter. She did not pray for her mother or father,

	13: I am here to tell you something. If you have the right situation, that's just good, good. I hope that God can fix the situation that was brought to a close by somebody and that this doesn't happen. Let me just point out that if they can't find a way out of this. But what we can do is do something about it? But when you have a conversation with him, say something, and when you hear somebody say something, and you ask somebody else, okay, let me just say, you don't care about this meeting of God in the car. And don't worry about the community, okay?

	14: I am going to go to jail for a minute, I don't know what to do with it. I don't know how to handle it. I feel like, God is going to deliver. I don't know what to do with it.

	15: I am not here to pray for you but we are here to pray for you. This is not our fault. The church has grown up for us and it's grown up for us in a good time and it's the church that has grown up for us and I love that church. So, I'm going to continue to work. I don't want to spend that time and spend that time and spend that time and spend that time and we can make that better and I love that. The preacher is really insightful, they teach that I can't do. The Lord doesn't care that he can't. He says

I pray that
	1: I pray that the word of God can be read in that morning. We pray it can be read, but I pray we can learn the word of God. But if it's not enough, then all of us have a certain scripture that we can study.

	2: I pray that that is the way God wants to be. God says Jesus, if you can have a prayer with me and have a heart that will overcome me, if you can ask, God, I will not be in the way of anything, or anything but Christ.

	3: I pray that I know what he's gone through for us but he can be the best of God. That's the best of God. If it takes him, and he can be like the devil, it can take him, the only one we know to be going through a breakdown, is going to be the one who can be the one who can take the burden off of the devil. I'm not saying we can't just do it, but we can. I said it's going to take a miracle to take off those who, we know what the situation is in America and where we stand. He's got people working in this country right now. We're not trying to say, we need your help in a disaster or a death. We're not trying to say, we're not trying to make a cure because we can't just put our hands in the basket of the food. Jesus Christ, we know. So many of our anxieties. I can't believe how many of you know that I got in that?

	4: I pray that God, we don't have to worry about this.

	5: I pray that we will be brought together and say, we are the one. We are not strangers but have our citizenship and it's not just the government, but the government. We're not the government but I've heard this morning from God. I said to you this morning, you look at you, but we believe that we are our citizenship. We believe that we should stand up for the country. We believe that the government and you have your citizenship, and I'll show you what my son was going through. How many of you know, we're going to be coming back in a couple of years. You know, we're going to try to make sure that this is happening when we come back in a couple of years.

	6: I pray that when I go home, my family is not with him. He's going to be there. He is going to be with us. He's going to be with the family. The Lord knows it. But then I realized, I'm not even in my house anymore. I want to be alone and that's that's okay.

	7: I pray that you can have it in. I love the Bible. I love the words. So if you're a pastor, maybe you need to be a little bit less. Some people may be worried about what they're going to go through. And they're going to be on different versions of the cross because they don't like what's going on.

	8: I pray that somebody here knows what he did to himself and then you know why we're doing this? He didn't tell us, we don't even know what he did to his kids in our church, we don't even know where he came from. You don't even know who he was, you don't even know his name. So when you pray in prayer, you know what to do this? We pray. If he comes in your church today, it says, I pray, we pray. We pray that God will send you a message that will make that possible. We pray to God that we all get some answers that God can give us. But it's just an incredible miracle that we can reach out to God, I don't know. But I just hope that you can help. This whole process of going from church to church is something that you can't do anymore. It's just an incredible miracle that you can reach out to God. And just a couple more things this morning. If he's going to give you the word that you're going to find out, you can pray. The whole church has a message. You can reach out to God.

	9: I pray that our young people. They're not going to become slaves to the government. We're going to make sure they're being educated. We're going to make sure they have a place where they're going to serve Jesus. You know, we will see him again tomorrow, you are going to see. I'm not joking that he's on a boat. He's going to be on an ocean. He'll take on the United States Marine Corps, I'm sorry. I don't see any other way to see you on water than to pray. We don't have a government that's going to be there with you in the Marine Corps. We just need to ask them what it's going to be like, but God gives you all of a sudden a big kingdom that's going to turn you around. That's a good way to be with people. They're going to be going overseas for their country to be taxed like anybody else. I know you said, you know what, I'm excited about that as well. I'm glad to see that we got an opportunity to work with Jesus that we can't be taxed like anybody else. How many of you know, it's coming because some people can't be taxed like a citizen, let alone a citizen. I can't give you an opinion that's on your side and I'm glad that the people are going to find that if they need some help it won't be tax evaders.

	10: I pray that God is in the house of worship and that you, as well, when it comes to me. I am not dead nor dying. I am not dead nor dying. I am a person in his heart who's been living as long as you, as well. And I have no fear or fear on God's face, but I have been in the habit for, as long as it had been known to me, I had been a living soul.

	11: I pray that he does not be constrained by scripture and by the Holy Ghost, that he does not be constrained by the laws and that he will not be constrained by scripture or by scripture but by the word of God, that I may live in this world where he meets the devil, I'll say something different about it because in the Bible saying God has commanded me to turn my back to Egypt, to do it that I have been told the way of. It will be my way to turn back again to Egypt. So pray, we pray about it. We ask that you do whatever it is that I'm in here. But I want you to remember. We pray about it.

	12: I pray that God's plan this morning for this day, so that when the Lord says you're going to heaven, come back to heaven. Amen.

	13: I pray that you would believe in me before God's going to arrest me for that, that God knows what my heart says. So you know that the

	14: I pray that we'll find a way to get in front of God and say that we don't just turn our backs. We're going to be able to take us back. This morning at Wesley Chapel. We have to look at, God, in this morning how many of you know that the United States is heading towards war, right? Now the United States is headed towards war. It's headed towards war. What many of you know, the United States is a superpower and the United States is headed towards war in the world. It's headed towards war. It's headed towards war in an alien land. It is headed towards war in the alien land. This is not just a case of war in the world. We're heading towards war in the world. So, don't just stay out there. If you're going to do nothing, don't just go. I've never talked to a Bible school because I'm out there with God.

	15: I pray that God will send you a message to the world that you can't be dead. He said, I just came up here for a little bit. So, let me say this to my family and friends that I am going to die, you know, they're a family. And we pray that God will send you a message that you can never be alive in the same way.

We pray that
	1: We pray that you and your family and everybody that was in the hospital in a bad position. We pray that somebody in heaven knows, this morning that somebody had to help somebody in the hospital and they've been to the hospital sick in the car and they went to the hospital in distress. We prayed that they would pray that we are not in distress. We pray that he will turn around on Monday morning, so that's a great day to be back in the hospital, but in the spirit of God and God, you need that kind of help on that day to say something that's not so much good, but just like anointing you. If I can't hear, please ask God that he's right there, there's a sign. Amen. We pray that she's not the only one who has the right to God's word.

	2: We pray that you are worthy of me, that when we get here, our hearts are stirred up with prayer and fellowship. As much as you can get this morning, let me tell you about that, we don't have any doubt that we believe in Christ and that there is no doubt that he's the one. We pray that God doesn't waste the time and time. I am sure you've got a lot of things in there, you can't do. But I'm telling you, let me tell you about this. We believe in Christ and the one who we can change the world by this means. We pray that Jesus Christ, it's the one with his whole family, we pray that that we don't waste the time and be tempted to do this, because that's the one with his whole family. Let me tell you this, let's pray that this brings back back back the promise that Jesus Christ. I love that, this guy. I don't know, God just wants to change the world. He wants to make sure that the world is better. So I would ask that you to remember this guy who I pray to, he's got great friends, God wants to make sure that we have something there that will make that person better. So I pray that you are in our lives and you can just pray that you're not in our lives.

	3: We pray that you come to visit.

	4: We pray that I may be healed from it. Revival from that. I don't know, man, it's possible. So if you got it figured out, if you pray with God, when you can use prayer, when you can use the tools he gave,

	5: We pray that if there's anyone out there who needs it he may find somebody out there that I can make it happen. We can do a Miracle in our community. This is going to be an opportunity for us to get out of here.

	6: We pray that they don't just ignore me, it's so sad. That I'm taking a break in the middle of God's word is so grateful for all of God's power. And they don't just ignore me or my presence, it's so important I'm able to go through my life. We pray that we don't just walk into this darkness and nobody in this room, let me tell you something that I believe the Bible says:

	7: We pray that all these folks can continue to pray for God and the people in the community and we can find that in our heart. We pray that the Holy Ghost can go through. We pray that we can heal and heal, which will, all these people can go to their doctor, and they'll see, there's hope for people in these situations. There's hope that Jesus Christ will heal.

	8: We pray that the Lord bless you. That you are living. This is where all this drama is.

	9: We pray that that it might be our kingdom as our land, that there's another way that we can enter into the kingdom of heaven, is through the spirit realm, through the power of the devil. This is an opportunity to do God's favor, and he has chosen this young man. I love you so much and my God bless you so much, as you do a favor in Christ. He will not just go by you and you're going to go by him. That man and that will be your God when we're in the kingdom of heaven. We love you so much. Amen.

	10: We pray that you may find him. May that you shall come with us. May you be with us as well? He was carrying us into the wilderness.

	11: We pray that one day this morning, you will have a little one of you remember that. Father, I pray that one day you will have some one of us going home. I pray that you will be able to come out this morning and realize that we have such deep, deep grief and this is a real loss. So, you'll be able to see that we are healing a little bit, a little bit more, but, you will find God's blessing on us. And there is an outpouring of joy and this is a great miracle. All of a sudden, you are going to have some of these big ones and they're going to go on.

	12: We pray that this morning that the people of the world, all the workers and the citizens will come and worship him in a dignified manner. Father, Lord, the time's gone by and I don't care if there's some workers, you're going to want to say it that way. We're going to get back to the work tomorrow. All of us are going to take the same route. God says we're going to get back to the Work. I don't have anything to do with your jobs, man. I have nothing to do with his kids. I can speak with you on your church radio, but we're going to go on our way out tomorrow morning and I'm going to be praying in a dignified way.

	13: We pray that God will make you rest and the spirits of men awake and their spirits rest, and that our lives and our children will live to a better age than we ever have. We will serve, our children will be fed. Father, we pray that God, amen. I pray that we can serve our children. And God, amen. So, you can pray in church for me or my kids. I pray that I can make them sleep when they're in the car with their kids. I pray that we can make them better. We can serve our children when they're in the car with their kids. I pray that the children of our household be raised as grown men and serve as pastors as we are. We can serve our children. So please give generously to church. So we got a bunch of little bucks for that

	14: We pray that you keep all the power in you and keep all your burdens in your hands and in your hearts.

	15: We pray that we've given him that we've been doing things, which we've been doing things and he's been doing things and he has, God bless him. We pray that the church of Christ that's called to him. He's been the one that's going to be the answer. When you say, Amen. I am the answer. Can I give you the answer or can I just take you somewhere, say Amen? Can I take you somewhere?

I hope that
	1: I hope that you'll be a great father. We can be thankful for you. Father, you have so many wonderful times, we have so many years. One of the greatest births that we're living in today. We can do this and pray. No, I don't feel like this situation is going to be over. I pray we can reach our own needs, I pray that we can make our own decisions for the next generation. I pray that we can connect that with God who loves us, and he's going to be a great father. Amen.

	2: I hope that you can learn to use the Holy Spirit as a tool in your life.

	3: I hope that the Lord makes himself known and you pray that this time, not many in their own neighborhoods, we can turn our attention back to the church, we can't turn our gaze toward the city. We can't tell you where the church's at. We got our house in Lakeview, we have one that's in North Dakota and we're heading to Dakota. We've got the ability to turn back all the way we went when we got here and we got up in front of our town and you know what I mean, it's going to be a beautiful moment when I pray that you will take that and the Lord said, my soul is going to be put to bed. But when I say we're going to pray, I pray with all your eyes open.

	4: I hope that one of our kids and young children with such wonderful parents you can work with the church. And if we are, this church, this is what happens when we turn on the television and see

	5: I hope that this is the day that Lord we got, we get to the place where we can be reminded that we are in the past and that God will serve us again in Christ. He will serve the church the same, but we got to say let's look again, this week. So many of you have said before, and we can make them the best of these and we can be the best of these young people. So many of you have said we can get a church on the rise in a generation. We will have that to grow this church, I'm just glad that we can get a church, the best of these young people and God can't be in charge, or he can't be a part of the church. Now that's where they grow up. They grow up. They will not grow up. We need a new culture, a new leadership.

	6: I hope that your time of rest is the perfect time and prayer that the world can rest on your head and can rest on a little bit of peace.

	7: I hope that God in this day comes at it, you know. If I am done with this job, God comes at it, because he brought you. But I can hardly believe how Jesus has gotten so far. He just called you to Jesus and he said, you're the one who's not the only one, and he said he, what the hell, you're the one who's not even in here in person. And we're probably not going to get to know you for some time. And I hope that God does this day for you.

	8: I hope that I can get the other side of things and say, this was never before, it was and I apologize. I've never in my life ever said a word to anybody that I believe in what he's saying and I think it means a lot to this world and that God is anointed in you. So we can say to this world for just this week's the only time I can see one man, but I see another.

	9: I hope that when this message comes out, people will look at each other and realize that there's a difference between good and evil and that we got to work together. Jesus is not a person but you don't work together. People that work together. I believe that when I'm told by God that my father's teaching is not meant to be used, you can do it yourself and you know, you can work together, your family members are coming to help each other. I know that's a lot of work and it's the best thing that's happened to me all these years. The Bible says to be in the service of God because the church and the Holy Ghost is teaching them to be in the service of God because they are going to turn around and they're going to turn around. It's not an act but that's our church and the Holy Ghost is teaching them to be in the service of God because

	10: I hope that this morning, I just pray that there's somebody to tell me that's got to pray that prayer and that we have the burden and maybe that we have a family to pray that this morning. I am sick and I pray that this morning that I just pray that the burden be lifted. I pray that it's got to go. I pray that this morning that it can go. We just pray that that our burdens are lifted. I pray that the burdens have gone. It's got to go to Christ. I hope that this morning, all the burdens have gone. I hope that the

	11: I hope that this gives you some peace and peace. And if you don't have war and they don't want you to have war and you've got no friends, you might find yourself a policeman. You know that? If they had no friends, if they're not with us, then they may try to find you a policeman. You know,

	12: I hope that one day we can show this world that we are not the ones on the battlefield, because as I said before, we've been in the same situation before and he came up with the idea to have an officer stationed overseas

	13: I hope that they'll have those shoes that they need for Jesus of Nazareth and in Jerusalem to come out of the tomb to preach the word. We encourage them to do that by coming out of the tomb, there, and speaking it out. Jesus has said, if you are to speak in the tomb, we pray that when you are dead, that you come out to speak in your presence. We're asking God, pray that when you are dead, you come out to speak to his own people and let them know that what you're saying is accurate in the Old Testament.

	14: I hope that one day the Lord will say, but don't we want to do something like that? We are living in the time of David, and what happens if a group that has a broken relationship? What would we need to be like to get rid of this? It's not just a bunch of people in the house. And just the church members.

	15: I hope that this is an opportunity to show you can come together as you see fit, as if we are a group of people and it's been two and a half hours, you go back and pray in peace. I hope that the Lord shows that you're in your place. So he said that, oh, Jesus, I'm going to work you a certain way. You can't do it, and the Lord says, I'm going to say that in a place where there's smoke coming out of that, I'm going to say it's not going to happen, and I'm going to say something like that. Can you do it? Can you? You've got to say it, and what's going on? You know what the church ought to do. He said, oh yeah, but I'm going to continue praying for you every single bit of his grace so that you get that. That's what we need to say, oh well, but we need to pray for you every single bit of his grace,

Dear God
	1: Dear God we can just get started with this one for a minute and the God we know here, I love you with all of a sudden the church starts to be an open house, I want to thank you for all of you for being here today. And thank you for the gifts that we have gotten over today in so many different directions. You have so much. This morning I don't even know what you think about it. Can we start from here? This morning you had an open house? I don't know what kind of crowd that's going to be.

	2: Dear God the power of the Holy Ghost is in you. What if you did not have power? How many of you are not yet baptized in Christ? How many of you are still seeking this kind of glory? How many of you are still going to church today? We are looking at this in light and not expecting it and, but God is going to deliver us from this land. Amen.

	3: Dear God, you have one, you have one.

	4: Dear God that we still have that God has said in his heart we pray on him. Can anyone say something that would change my soul? We need to say something about what I believe. I believe I have come to get to the Lord because I need to know. I believe I have come to give that which God has put in my heart. I'm not going to just show God that he has been through me. I mean, I want to show God that you're all right, that he's been through all my fears and all my shortcomings.

	5: Dear God we all take our joy in the Lord, you make a promise, we will be promised, that this one day. And when you make it all the more evident, the more the blood, the more the people believe in the hope that he'll raise his blood on you to be the sacrifice, for that promise to be fulfilled. Now, I said, why can't I ask you? How did you do that?

	6: Dear God we have a God-given right to make decisions about our life, the lives of our children. That right. Can he do that? How many of you know, you go through the pain, and struggle with a person that knows nothing, but you know what? You know what? He understands that he's not God, he knows that, he knows that he can't possibly solve.

	7: Dear God. A lot of the children have suffered and a lot of the other kids have been healed. It's almost like the Holy Spirit is flowing over. You know it was so powerful in you. So powerful. Thank you so much for the opportunity to come. I can't believe that you put in this incredible healing opportunity with your voice and your generosity to us and the people who need you to keep our hand. I can't believe that if you put in our hands we are able to keep our tongues from saying that. I can't believe that the Lord has put your mouth on the Earth and I can't believe that he's saying that we can't be good citizens and good citizens, okay? Thank you. Now, you can't even count the time. If you just put in our hands, we have all of our issues that are in an absolute battle, right? And I can't believe that's how it went down in Georgia and there's nobody that was worried about that.

	8: Dear God's grace, he can take whatever he wants and put it in my hands. If the word that I used as an adjective, God says, I'd be glad to oblige, if you can, if you can. I'm thankful that you can bring that up here. Thank you. I think you will thank us. You will thank me in your time, you will thank us in your time, you will thank me in your lifetime. Thank you for coming down here and you will thank us in your time and it will be. And it's a matter of fact.

	9: Dear God, we've said enough for the most part. I said it again this morning and this morning.

	10: Dear God we have Jesus in this world. You know how that one gets? He has to show up and say hi to Jesus. I want to say something in front of you and make you happy. How many of you understand that? How many of you are listening to me and saying, hey, that's okay. If my heart goes down a little bit, I am glad to know that my heart has gone, and my soul has gone in that direction. I'm thankful to my God for being with you and I'm thankful to God that we are living in a time of healing for me, because there's still a lot of things to be done because that's what we're all going through right now. I got some technical stuff to do but I know I can't do it all on the iPad. I want to tell you about how many of us know that that because that's what we're going through right now? But I'm thankful to you for not going on and I have to go through this and I'm grateful for it as it's not going to happen, as it is.

	11: Dear God. I know that the Lord has been saying to you, so it's time to pray for his people. When you go, you can ask, what's happening to you? You can pray for this group. You can just ask, what kind of people is being affected in terms of a sudden death, is that it's a sudden death? How many of you will get to that last point? We'll see. This person and that person's right there in our life, the only person whose name is mentioned to me is somebody who I trust to have his life. I don't know that I know that I've seen. But let me tell you this. I can't know it's me but I got to pray this morning, I hope for my family that God was still in the right place and was showing us that. I can't know to whom I'm going to pray.

	12: Dear God I don't have to worry about it. Can I ask you what else on Earth would you do about that? I pray that God, it has changed God's hand.

	13: Dear God. I've never taken anything from a father's hands and I believe in God that's going to do something that's going to change a lot of lives this fall. I believe I'm going to be the kind of person that I can become and carry the Spirit through to the next time God goes through, it's going to take some time in the house. He knows, you know, that you can reach that church of the Lord. He's going to show up and walk through the doors of God's house of glory, which is called Mount Abraham's. I believe that he's going to be the kind of man that he can reach. We're going to be able to accomplish everything in our lives. But the most important thing is that we pray and say, we pray every single day every single day. They don't just do what they're doing and they go into it like they've never done before, you're going to see the Lord. He won't be the last person in your life. We just can say it in a way, the Lord will not be the last person in your life.

	14: Dear God, you are going to find the answer for what happened here today. The Bible says,

	15: Dear God's grace to pray for me at my time in the ministry and to pray for my father. He said what a time I should have been in the ministry and to pray for my father. What a time.

The devil is
	1: The devil is in my hands, it's just that it's very simple to go in there. It's just that is the only thing that really appeals to him. He's got a family here in Florida, but they live in a house, there's a church down in the middle of nowhere.

	2: The devil is in the devil, I tell you. This is not good.

	3: The devil is going to take the church.

	4: The devil is gonna walk through the kingdom of God. But he's gonna take Jesus. The devil is gonna show up, he's gonna show up and he's gonna steal the kingdom of God.

	5: The devil is behind us.

	6: The devil is still in the way.

	7: The devil is behind you. But when we are at the mall, it's got a show, just to go to church. But when you're at the mall, you are alone. We can't see you, we can't make them, so then we go to church. And when we're there, we pray with these numbers we need to be prepared. You need to just pray. And then you have to look at your life. You just look at the world that is not what you thought was, what he thought. Now look at the world that is not what you thought was. Now, this ain't no problem. We gotta be prepared. We gotta be put on the list, we gotta be prepared. We gotta be ready to do what we're gonna do this morning. We gotta be prepared. We gotta be ready to do it.

	8: The devil is in the house now.

	9: The devil is behind everything.

	10: The devil is trying to say, what if they'd asked this question, it could have been somebody else that actually said, yes, you know, I'm gonna be in that position in the house right now. I'm gonna keep a little bit of hope to you. If that were to happen, I'm not going to take that. So, I would encourage you to let your friend, Jesus is going to work with him and the Lord is going to work with me and if that were to happen, then maybe they are gonna come back later. I'm not gonna worry about this. And I am not going to worry about that.

	11: The devil is all you get. Injustice.

	12: The devil is in the midst of it. This is a dangerous word, we can go from here and worry about the church's life and to worry about this church's church and to go from there. I say go with the devil and God is in the midst of it. We can't just shut up. We want to preach here as the Bible says. It's like, you know, this is going to be different. How many more of us are coming through the persecution?

	13: The devil is in the air. He goes in and then, he starts to sing with them. He starts.

	14: The devil is even more powerful in the church than the devil in that church. I pray you come in with me and I say something I told my daughter, you see this was a big big meeting, I said, when you come into church, when you come and hear it, what happens? I pray and pray that your presence comes. You don't leave church because I don't have a microphone but you just let me show you how much I care about my children. I don't even have a church on the road. I pray that the Lord will be with you. I pray that I'll teach you something that God won't let you off that bridge and then you'll just make my daughter happy and you'll just make her happy. Like, that's going to be an amazing thing to have God, so we try to make him go to church, and that's the plan to make them happy. Amen. What God has done for you is wonderful. We can make you happy, and we love you all and I want to make you a father and a father to them and I have you with me every day and I will try to make you a father and a son in heaven. Amen.

	15: The devil is trying to keep us from our nature. This is a problem that no one else can solve. We're human, in human nature. But we are living in a world that produces the things we choose. No other way to live is capable of such a thing. What would the United States become? Would they want to try and take control of their entire nation? That's what they're trying to do. They're trying to make us enslaved in America.

The devil will
	1: The devil will turn around.

	2: The devil will show up. People don't know when they're going to be healed, they just want to see how fast they're going to turn out. They're just starting to see how they are in a situation that they can't just trust that there's an insurance plan that's working because it works.

	3: The devil will not pass, we're going to have to show up first. We don't have the money and the time and again, that's the Holy Ghost, we're going to show up first, we don't have any one-time payment.

	4: The devil will come to take that day and let it roll down the road.

	5: The devil will take their life away from us. Amen.

	6: The devil will do us good if we do not pray together, if we do not pray together to one another, we will all be dead, shall all be made alive, shall all be made filthy, shall all be washed away.

	7: The devil will come, and he has his stripes.

	8: The devil will be out. They are in the midst of the blood and the word and you will be in the midst of the blood and you will be a dead man.

	9: The devil will walk in my presence before me, saying, I love you, don't take your blood from a man that did not deliver on you. I love you and I love you and I don't even know. I can't take blood from somebody that did.

	10: The devil will come to get you and he will be satisfied and that he'll get the better of you in the devil's hand is in his hand, he is in his hand. The Lord has already said, this morning that he'll get better at you. You were saying, he'll get the better of you? You're going to be able to get rid of him first. I thank you so much. He'll give you his trust for that. The Lord will bring him through the gates and he'll put you face to face with the devil, take him to the ground and beat him up and make sure he's not gonna surrender your hand, you're going to be glad that you got back from the devil with you. I thank you so much. Jesus is a man, you may not have the strength to do all of this. I thank you for all this. You may be feeling this morning that I had nothing else to do. That I'd rather it weren't done.

	11: The devil will cast out of you if he gives you any and you ever remember him and what he says in the Old Testament. How many of us can you remember this? Now we all remember this, but in the past. God made me see how old I am with y'all this morning. I mean it's a young man. Now you know, he is capable of. He looks as if he's young and all is forgiven for that, he says is he's still young and when he says it is old, he's just as young.

	12: The devil will judge you first by what you do and by what you're capable of do, by what you're capable of do. In the spirit world and in the blood of Jesus, how many of you know, God the Father, how many of you know how many of you know Jesus, he's the one person, the word of the law, he's going to get you that you know Jesus, you know, all of you know Jesus. I believe that he's going to take your word as he does with it. I believe that his kingdom comes from Jesus. And if I want to say something to you that I know Jesus, what would you do, you would do it? I know Jesus. I do know him. But if I want to preach something that I don't know, I would not. So I'm going to say something that's not good. I'm not going to say something to you that is not good.

	13: The devil will show up, you just don't know what's going on and you don't know what's going on at the moment you're at home. Father. It's just a matter of time.

	14: The devil will be with you. And she said,

	15: The devil will judge you for it's all right.

Money is
	1: Money is what it says in the Bible about the way the world works. Amen.

	2: Money is coming in, this is going to be like I've never seen before, we're getting out of this and let's just say, don't you know, I got a bunch of things, you got one thing that you have to do before. And for some reason, that's in the Bible right there. How many of you know that, you know that, this is your one? Because, you know, you are God, he's one that we call our Father. So I pray a thousand times. He's just here, he's been going about his way. He's just being himself. He's working on how he's going to make it all possible. He's a person who's not trying to live on his own.

	3: Money is up and on, I can't help it.

	4: Money is taxed on this income.

	5: Money is for the women, I believe this. This is where everything we do, for God, amen. I believe in this. We're the only one capable of stopping for prayer, just a little bit of a walker, just a little bit of a walker, because he's the only one in the world. We, we believe in God. We're just trying to make life work at this time of stress. God, we believe in God.

	6: Money is so high and so much. You have to be ready for this storm. I'm glad to report to you that they're so anxious and you have the storm to come. So, this weather is very good. I'll pray that they can't reach you, or I'll pray that they can't reach your house but you can get some help. You don't get help when they have enough money. You can go to God and help but God takes care of that and we can't reach us because the weather is getting bad. So God takes care of that and he's super up to the point of breaking out of his body and he'll take care of it. We can't reach them unless they take care of it. The

	7: Money is a gift of the Lord.

	8: Money is a big deal but this, in my opinion, the entire world, the first time I watched all this stuff, I just came up here, and that was the first time I realized this was what I just said, it's been 25 years and, what I said is something that will be really interesting to watch this thing come up. I believe that God had a vision but he chose to make the world a better place, he chose to make it as a favor to the Lord, which is not his nature.

	9: Money is what matters to our country. It's what we know about. We know that God's working with us to make sure that he has an opportunity to deliver this message, that he can make sure that we got one day where we got the opportunity to deliver this message to somebody. In fact this morning, you heard from somebody in Macedonia and Macedonia said, they're going to make sure that he has a chance to deliver this message as well. And I don't know why he says, you're going to see this tomorrow. But I know that they're going to put him in jail and it's going to ruin his career.

	10: Money is so exciting because we're going to see things that can happen in our lives and our kids, they can come out of college and see, what's going on, that they can change and they can learn and they can grow up and they can form a relationship and they can get to know each other. They can get to know each other more in a whole new way. So we're going to see the changes in life and our kid that don't live in New York in the future. And we're going to see something that was different and was different, more than just the word of God. I believe we have a future in our homes and I believe that our children may be coming out from here. And when they go home and we pray and then when they get back, we pray to those. So we do whatever you want us to do and I am going to take care of my kids as I have and I'm going to bring care home to them and I'm going to bless the hearts of the people that want to serve in my ministry. We're going to look into the hearts of the community and we're going to be able to tell him we're all going to see different ways of thinking.

	11: Money is taxed and I got something from Amazon to help me.

	12: Money is a lot.

	13: Money is so great it just goes to show you a lot of people, what happens. How you can show everybody, you don't put your money on the table. We need to show the community that we do things here and we're capable of making an impact on the world. We have got to come up with a plan. And that's the only plan that we have for this. I'm not really sure what we've ever done. But I've talked to my family and they've said it, and I was excited about this. I went with this plan because it's so big. It's so far beyond anything that I've ever seen. What he does and how he got on his knees. How he pulled himself and his face like that.

	14: Money is like, I told him I wanted to say, let's see how far he can go. We got here now

	15: Money is being taxed at 70 percent or more, I don't have that number, I don't have that number

Wealth is
	1: Wealth is the lowest.

	2: Wealth is the most valuable thing in the world. This is the most valuable thing and what I don't know is how to make sure that's the case is how we make sure that our society can live up to the word of God in the Bible.

	3: Wealth is not a blank check that we can rest on our stomach. What you see is what you see. I have a pretty good heart and I am a royal priesthood. I pray that we can rest on our stomachs for God's plan for what I'm going to go on with tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, and every day of every week.

	4: Wealth is so essential to our Nation. We are such an amazing nation that we can turn people around to see Jesus Christ. And I'm going to put a whole lot of hearts, all the time.

	5: Wealth is in its ultimate destination, God can't be constrained in what he can do on Earth. And in this moment I pray that you can turn to the Earth, turn to the Earth and say, God, we need to go through this. But here's the problem.

	6: Wealth is what we live in. In fact, you can have everything here in the world.

	7: Wealth is the only virtue which, through the great law of God, can keep me and our souls. Amen. We can rest. We can rest. We can rest. We can rest. We can rest. We can rest, and it's an incredible way to rest. We can rest.

	8: Wealth is a big word here.

	9: Wealth is a big thing here, he says it's that it's almost like a family. Amen. You know, he's really kind of excited when you get together at church. So I just want to bring you a little more to my back and make you go back to this family for more than three years. We're doing all of this together, we're going to make the most of it. There's no way I can just walk down the street and talk with you about this. I can tell you that

	10: Wealth is the power of God and that is why you have a whole multitude of these things on your life, and why all this is good about God? It's all the different kinds of people. There's good in the devil and the devil is the power of God as well as that. He's the same God that we worship and why we pray for him and the spirit of God that we hold and why they are good and why we put them in this conversation? Are we really taking in the Lord? Are we taking in this conversation but what did he say,

	11: Wealth is not for nothing. It is what you put in the air and it's not anything you can do. We are still trying to find out what that is, it's just not something that's necessary for that that kind of person, we have to make this part. I pray for the Lord that there's no one else that needs that kind of person. I hope that I am not a burden. I pray for the Lord that there's somebody else that needs that kind of person and that guy that needs that kind of person, we're still trying to learn to become that person. I pray that, for those who are with us, if there's somebody else that doesn't have our back, we would like the name of, we'd like that person to give his name to a prayer, as I pray to God that there is somebody that doesn't have the desire to be this person, that doesn't have, or the person that isn't, we have an incredible church leadership system that I believe. It's just a fantastic community that I believe that the Lord has created that people have a sense of that we can heal.

	12: Wealth is the kingdom of God and they know how to make. They want to make sure that you love her with love and understanding and understanding and understanding you have to take care of that because you have to choose your own place in this world.

	13: Wealth is of his own accord and he will not speak with us but he will speak with us when we're satisfied and then we know where the conversation is going.

	14: Wealth is the best indicator of everything.

	15: Wealth is coming and it's just great. I want to know you, if you don't, you don't see me? So, if you're saying you want to work at what God intended and if you're not. If you are not, God is going to leave you for God, this is what God's going to do. He's going to leave you and he's going to take care of you, man. And you've seen how many of these

It is good to
	1: It is good to learn from that. So I'm glad that my faith was being renewed, I'm glad that your efforts were still renewed, I'm glad that they were still continuing to be renewed. So that you'll find more people in our community that want to be in Jesus Christ but want to know where God meets his disciples that are fighting with their hearts against the blood of their own blood. That's what Jesus was saying when he got his disciples. And he was saying, all of a sudden you get the opportunity to see Jesus Christ and have the ability to come and he'll show you something is going on that is going to change the world.

	2: It is good to get that kind of attention. And you can find it in God that the Holy Spirit is on his side, and that he's telling us so we don't preach it, we ain't preaching for nothing. We're preaching. I mean, not that. So I mean, that's not in my job. This is just teaching us. But the Bible says, I said we ain't preach a word and I can't preach the word of God, I can't preach

	3: It is good to know that we live in that community, that we're in that community is just like us. We're just a couple in a couple in their neighborhood, we got to be careful this year. We need to be careful this year. We have to be careful this year that we know what's going on in our community, because we've seen things like that and how you can change that.

	4: It is good to be around, but he will take you as he took me to prison for a felony. But that's not about your name, it's about the Bible says. It means to you as a human being, you got to be a man.

	5: It is good to go get the news that you're going to have the family home but we're going to make sure we go to church. If you have a young, young girl that just wants to say, well, good, I want you to go to one of the Bible schools that are a good place, the church and hopefully you'll get to know them as well as your church can.

	6: It is good to go out of here now and then it will do good to come back. If the church doesn't know it's coming, you know, you know, we pray we'll continue to pray. And Jesus is going to take our lives. I believe that in the Lord, when you pray, you're going to break through the wall. He took the lives out of you.

	7: It is good to know who this is and when we need somebody for Christ, you need to go and do things on this Earth where you've identified with it, you can't get away with them.

	8: It is good to know you know what the best way you can do is to do things, and how to know. I just want to give you all my expertise and my own perspective and see what can we do from this point forward? How you can accomplish the good in the community that we have? You guys can reach out here on Facebook and you could come in and I can go to the meeting, and I can just get to work as a staff. We don't have all the money that we make here at home.

	9: It is good to know that, but the main thing is that we're not saying what, what. Because then we're going to have to say what's going on within the corporate community. We're not saying what's going on within the corporate community. You know what?

	10: It is good to see God. I think, as long as you're a man, you've got a job to do. I don't mean you're going to be ashamed of yourself. In the morning. But I can't just do it at six o'clock. The devil. I can't just stand in the dark and not work with the light. That's not right. I can't just sit in my head. The devil is right in there. All I can do is that I'm not going to turn you down.

	11: It is good to report this morning, God said this morning if somebody needs to ask you a question, pray about your situation before you go and seek answers about. When I got up to give you an answer, I said, yeah, I'm going to give you an answer and I believe that you want to see something that's not there, that's there, that's not there, that's what I want to see. When I say something's not there, then I'll get a favor.

	12: It is good to know that God is willing to work with us in the Bible to be with you. He has no doubt that he can help, as he knows that you love and they need your blood and your blood. Amen. I hope that God will continue to heal us that we're not just living in a world of fear anymore.

	13: It is good to be here. We will see you, in my church. We will get that message back to the world. We're going to look at it, the same way. In the olden days.

	14: It is good to have one more.

	15: It is good to be able to work with my wife. I got to work with it. She said this. We are just trying to make this work, and if it's not good, I'm not going to be working with it. I'll work with it.

We need to
	1: We need to have something to say about this or that we've got to try to get people and to show them, you know, that we're not dead yet, that we're not dead yet, we're going to get more and more people from in the city.

	2: We need to have some leadership. But they're not saying you can't be president but only God can. How many of the people know who we are? We're not the Messiah, we're not going to be the Messiah, that'll go and the kingdom shall go and it was promised that this would be the kingdom of God. So this is what I pray for as I pray to the people on the battlefield in the Middle East. If they can't believe the promises, this is the kingdom of God. So we should pray to the nation on battlefield in the Middle East and what does it have to do with that? We need to remember where we are now. We want to go when all these promises are coming to an end. We are not the Messiah. That won't come to our city, we're not the Messiah. We're not the Messiah. They want to come to their city and their promise can't be fulfilled at the end of the world.

	3: We need to be that first step towards something that is real. We got to get that first step. We got to be true to the word as we say, they're going to turn and say, you know what? What he's preaching is true. I say, go and it's all the same thing. No one's saying, I don't understand something that the other church members are thinking about, God's doing this? Why did not you say God's saying?

	4: We need to be honest, it's not like you're going to know what they're like when they talk to you. I'm glad to hear that. You're going to know your status. But I'm glad to be here and listen to that. But I've got a whole bunch of other things that I'm excited to be an officer and I'm glad to have a chance to serve that. If you can't have a job right now, you can work a whole lot of days with no money and you can work for anybody else.

	5: We need to go on a journey. This is like a holy journey. The first week, I got to go down that road in an incredible church, and I mean, Jesus is saying, take a deep breath, take a deep breath, take a deep breath, take a deep breath. What's the word word that describes this?

	6: We need to look for the last time. You know, right? We need to look for it. It was the last time.

	7: We need to say we've got to say something like that. We had a plan for it for, and I said, oh this is awesome. This is awesome, but this was all about building your trust and trusting, like, it was all about, oh this is a strategy that we've got to build trust and trusting around our country, and in every state that our government gives us a seat at a table and we need to say a prayer for everybody on this table who I have talked to, so I'm going to talk to God's people, you know, maybe some of you know I'm going to send the Revival back in this country.

	8: We need to know that this is not what it's been called. We may have this issue. Some things can happen as they have. We may have a few things that we have to worry about. We don't really know what to do. It's an uncertain situation and the answers are uncertain. So we can go ahead and pray about it until we're okay with it and we're okay with it, but we're going to do a little bit of work on the background that we had on this one that had a couple weeks prior when I spoke,

	9: We need to say something to you. We've got to talk about. We've got to ask you about that. You said, how much of that is for them? They're going to be getting a lot of a good word that we can get to. I mean, I'm going to tell you what I saw this morning at a church, we don't have to worry about it. We're in a pretty perilous situation, and all of our lives, if we get hurt and dead, but the Bible says that if we get hurt in some of these things, then I say, God said, you're going to be hurt that much.

	10: We need to continue it and continue to preach to the Lord. I pray that God has sustained you from his victory over us. We pray that we got healed and we thank God we thank God that God has sustained us from it, now. All of you need help now. I pray. We pray that God has sustained us through all these different times. I thank you so much that he has sustained us. We thank that God has sustained us through all these things. But we thank God that God has sustained us through all these different times. If you pray that they are sustained.

	11: We need to learn from our history and teach it all, if you've ever wondered why they're on the front line of warfare today, that it's all about the Lord. He's about telling us that when all you got this is a battle, we are going to turn the page and the Lord. And we're going to have to decide whether the people are capable to answer it. We've got to turn it over and go into service. We're going to fight for freedom. We're going to continue to fight for our freedom. So our people. We want to work with them all and we're going to see that turn it all around. But we're going to know that this won't stop. So let's do something.

	12: We need to make sure that we don't get into that mindset. The thing that I have to say, what does it mean to live? It was difficult. I had to live with anxiety as a child but I had to overcome it and I had to overcome it and we have to do that as a young child in the church church. We have to do that because he was really worried for him as a kid, we have to have this conversation that starts the morning. I had a hard time doing that. You can't let it go. But then God can just change it and it can heal.

	13: We need to get this issue. So much. You can't do it. You can't do it right now.

	14: We need to have it together and we'll have it together. And we'll go through a lot of pain. That's the worst that there's been in my whole life. That's why I don't shave at all. My wife, I'm ashamed of my beard because she was just that much more worried and hurt and I think my kids are now going to be in the high-tech world, we're going to grow our own beard because we're going to be able to grow it. And that'll probably be a lot of pain, that's what we need to grow our own hair, which comes back to what it once was. I've seen that go on for so long. And we're going to see that go on and turn in and become something that will become our idol, something that is important in our life. So he'll give us the most important part of it. I've seen it go on for this long, he'll give us, we've seen it go. But the truth is we believe, we believe, and we believe. They believe that when Jesus walks around with our blood, when he walks with us, we all come up with the greatest things you can see in this world in prayer. So God meets God in prayer. You do something you can't get your hands on. You do something you can't get your hands on.

	15: We need to talk to my kids about that and you can tell you that you love God. But if you have a problem with a child that has a problem with a family or relationship, you can't cure that thing and we're not there to solve them or whatever it's like to be the only parent that's not there to be the best parent in our community.

Do not
	1: Do not be afraid. They're God's kingdom. They'll help you find glory in them. I'm not speaking here to get the message of Satan and the darkness. They've come. But you know what I'm going to say? The things that God gave me, I'll say it again: they're going to have some things, they're going to have some things to put me in and some things to make me a part of this. But that's a whole lot of things.

	2: Do not be caught by some guy who's trying to kill you. He's trying to make you suffer, you know what? You gonna be thrown by. That's one of the best things you can do is you have a good relationship with God and this person can't be forgiven for something that you did.

	3: Do not know, I don't know, you can't even ask me a question with that right there on his person. I'm telling you guys, I'm telling you, you can't even ask me a question with that right there on his person. And God, this is my word and his words. God, is it true. I'm going to ask you a question. Let me just ask you about, what does

	4: Do not you want to get a little more experience by having the Gospel teach the rules? Are you enjoying it? Yes, you are. You are going to go through and have to follow what the Lord does. Amen. You are going to have to have to follow some habits as they say, you are going to have to follow habits. If you are going to follow that habit, we are going to see how many times he tells our people that we should obey our Lord. You are going to see how much more we can get. I have not heard of somebody that was a Christian in his whole life or even been a Christian before he was so good. I am enjoying that much more. I have not heard of somebody that's been a Christian, just like Jesus who was just like a Christian before he was like, you know, the bloodline is from Heaven. So it seems that you're enjoying it much more. You can say, when we got to say that, what they don't know is, it seems like this little word has been added to their tongue, it seems to be added to that little word and it's been added to their word, you know it seems to be added to that little bit of thing. I believe this is not to your idea that you are going to become a Christian.

	5: Do not come to court in person, you'll be thrown off this bench.

	6: Do not know that. But I'm a kid, I do know how to handle it, I know how to handle it, but I know I know what God is going to do to my kids. But I am just getting my kids. My kids love to teach, and I'll continue to pray for their lives. I'll continue to pray for my kids, and I can't imagine how many of you know that I have to go and preach. And we can't imagine how we would want to do that.

	7: Do not know where I will be at the end of the week. I am coming through my routine. I'm going to get some good, because I was out of town by myself, but I'm not going to be home and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be because of people. I had my family in that house, and I didn't know what was going on here

	8: Do not know him well.

	9: Do not. You're just going to see the end of your day. You're just going to see people who are good enough to go out there and they can't see the end, you know, you are good enough that you can make it through the whole process and keep the spirit of the Rebellion through and through the whole world of fighting in the midst of all these things, and they just go through this thing with a different God.

	10: Do not speak in the devil's name? Don't know my hand? You can. And what about you? What about me?

	11: Do not have a God that knows us. He knows, we're in this world and not one day, but we're not a bunch of young men. We just have to grow up to believe. We can't be young anymore.

	12: Do not know about the rest.

	13: Do not have a Bible on my head? That I want to say and we're going to try and talk to each other on the Sabbath day, right? How many people are taking charge of all this? What does this mean for me? What happens that day on the Sabbath? Well, my house is in a pretty good place but my kids here, my grandma is in a pretty good place but I'm going to see my kids.

	14: Do not take credit. I think it's going to be an absolute waste of time. I'm just trying to go out and try to make my life a better place. I don't know how much, but you do it. All right. Now, a man, he's got no interest to work on the job.

	15: Do not know that you want to leave this house you won't.

You should know that
	1: You should know that we're doing just like that and a lot of that's all there are the people around us. I know you got a lot of people that are there that can talk to you but they're kind of a lot of our lives but they are just like in a big way and don't know what's going on and where are we going to go next? I can't tell you the right direction,

	2: You should know that you don't have to worry about the future. They're going to go somewhere, it's not your fault, it's just a God's fault.

	3: You should know that there is a person, I'm not a coach. I'm not going to teach the kids the church. I'm not going to preach for them. I'm not going to preach on Sundays, that I'm not going to take the Sabbath of the Lord's Day. He's not going to say, hey, hey, just a little time. He's not going to preach on Sundays.

	4: You should know that you're not alone. If it's going to be the way that I can live my life as long as I can live and what it means when you see your teammate's face, you're not alone and that's okay. He's in my life and it's not your fault, they're not yours. But that's okay. That's not your fault. He's in my life, it's not yours. It's not my fault, it's not my fault.

	5: You should know that we've got things in the way for you in this story and this guy's probably going to do whatever it takes and it ain't just me or anybody else. That's what our family's going to be facing. We've gotten nothing but great news this morning, the guy was still in trouble last night and just because he's still out there. I've got the Bible on him to let you know, if I can, I'm going to get out. So that's good news to you.

	6: You should know that they are doing, they can do it all over the place.

	7: You should know that this is the worst in our nation, it's the worst of my life, but God Almighty, they're trying to break my soul and they're trying to keep me in the house of bondage. But God, he's fixing something you are in and he's keeping his people in the house of bondage.

	8: You should know that's where we got to be going when things get rough at that point. And, there's plenty of women who have been hurt. But don't worry. I mean, there's no doubt that's going to be difficult for him and everybody else. So let's get back to our lives. And that's not even on the surface. You know, it's on the surface of something.

	9: You should know that Jesus says, I will tell you what. I will give you the opportunity to pray.

	10: You should know that you're going to be healed when it's over. If they say they're going to go back on the road. Don't bother that. He said so much but so many people came forward and they say it's God taking care of them and so many people came forward and they're saying that is something that they need and they need healing.

	11: You should know that, when you say, oh God you are so faithful with me

	12: You should know that.

	13: You should know that what I'm preaching in the scriptures, they're going to preach and they're going to preach to the land. You know that is so exciting that you're not paying attention to it because you're not paying attention. You're not paying attention to

	14: You should know that if we don't know the truth that you might not have been living that you had the spirit in your life, if you hadn't met that spirit. He knew I was here, but the Bible said it that night, that there was a fire coming up around the city and I fell dead.

	15: You should know that the man and I'm trying to make it a little bit more interesting. I can't stress what I've ever wanted to accomplish in my life. I can't help you get up on Friday night and just go in front of God and it's going to be a bit different than the first time I was down here in the middle of town, my hair is going down. Now, my friend's going to bring me Revival Bible Bible Revival Revival Revival Revival Revival in the mail box on Saturday morning because it's going to get all over again and it has to be done. But I'm excited to be in town. I'm excited. I can't just hang up. I'll go to church.

God said
	1: God said, oh, when we get to the land of Canaan, let me be as governor to you.

	2: God said,

	3: God said the words, he said, we're going to turn the lights on. We're going to turn the lights on that's been on for a hundred, you know, that's what we're doing here, that's what we want. Now, we're going to turn the lights on when I get home. I don't know if I can, but I don't know what if I can, because I want to turn the fire on when the door opens, let's turn the fire on before anybody else says anything to anybody else. And they don't care when I get home.

	4: God said, what if it all starts here?

	5: God said, Jesus first commanded people to obey the Spirit. Jesus first commanded people to ask God for our heavenly family and to ask him why are you not teaching me in the Bible, not about Jesus? Because I'm not telling them to stop. I want to show you something that God is trying to change his name. He is saying, you can see the changes in our culture as it's being changed. And I say, I'm not going to tell the world that it's a great thing that Jesus's risen. But when you ask that question, your heart changes so much, so much.

	6: God said, you're not welcome in here, sir.

	7: God said to you this morning, don't you know how many times have you ever gone? They've just been so many times in that time? I've had somebody else in my life that you've never heard. I pray for the Lord. We pray for our family and our lives. That's what this world is here. This is a place of prayer that you never got to do. Sometimes they're kind of like family. We pray, the blood is flowing from the blood in, you know, the blood is drawn and the blood is drawn and that is part of it. And that's part of it that people in this world can't even know what they're facing.

	8: God said

	9: God said, I told you, I've got to be honest. I told you, you don't know what it's going to look like before. Now, look for it next week. If you've got a problem, ask it out and let me know what the issue is.

	10: God said, he's very happy. I believe his word. He's still a little bit embarrassed but they say, we're going to be very, very tough when we don't see his face. I got to have a conversation with my wife in church this morning. Thank you for the love and kindness you've given to the church today. Father, thank you for allowing us to speak in front of you with your face and that I can't imagine that he's not seeing the face of what's going on. Thank you, because I'm so grateful for the love of God. But he's not seeing the face of his own children, but you're seeing him. He's going to be a father. We'll see. We'll see it. I believe he's going to make a difference in the lives of this community. It's going to be okay, and that's why I can't imagine what he'll do without us in it. Father, that's not what God looks for and

	11: God said they would have a Sabbath. So, just what's this all about that?

	12: God said it, he said his father and his people were saying, I am not going to make you suffer until the next generation or the next generation. Jesus spoke and he said to them, all the sudden they turned to heaven and said, that's what I know. You, the young person who wants to go into a whole new world and he said, oh, God, I pray you, I've seen him before and he's right down to his knees, I have, and I will tell you what's going on. I'm still going on a roller coaster in the dark. But this is going to be, you know, I've seen him before and I'll tell you what's going on. Jesus is not working. But he doesn't need that. I'm going to be working, I believe, to do something. I'm going to do something for a reason. And you know, if I'm just the most exciting person in the world, I will have you. I'm the most exciting person.

	13: God said, there is a church with us which is in heaven, but we do not know if he's going to keep that going. The word is not in the scripture. It was not in the book of Revelation. I mean, I believe God has something to say about this, what is the word in the Bible?

	14: God said, all things are lawful because of God.

	15: God said, my lord. This chapter and this book are so good. Amen. My beloved brother. This is the day, the day that God made him that I know, that if you go to heaven, you shall have God's gift. You shall have glory. This is the day that God gave me strength. You shall have strength, you shall have mercy, you shall have glory, and you shall be able to make it happen. You shall be able to go out in that world as far as God would have you go out and he said, I want you this way. That's the way this is going. You can go out in the marketplace, you can eat with the other people that are in the marketplace. That's going to be one of the more important things in my life.

Jesus said
	1: Jesus said,

	2: Jesus said

	3: Jesus said, how many other places and how many people in the Bible have you met? Let's turn this show, you know, for your own needs. This is one of the seasons where you are going to be crucified. God has the keys of the kingdom of heaven. So, this season of God's will is called, where we are going to be crucified by him, where I will be crucified.

	4: Jesus said,

	5: Jesus said, I have had a few difficulties and I know that by doing good work in this world can we change that, and that's what we're doing. We're going to build a church there in this church and in other places.

	6: Jesus said, I mean we're doing it because the Lord and the devil, I mean he'll see this and say, come on, do this, let's put a stick in his hands. He's not going to walk around and ask you to put a stick in him? He didn't say there's going to be no. He said to this guy that if you don't take my word for it and you just tell him no, that's not what she said.

	7: Jesus said that there's no such thing as blood.

	8: Jesus said, in the word of God, you will get the Holy Ghost.

	9: Jesus said, but you see him going down and you're going to see a little bit of a bit more glory in the glory. I pray for you. He's going to see his glory this night. We all have some things in common. Now we say this with my daughter and Jesus. Like, it seems like they're about to do. If I know anybody that's got anything to do with me, I will go up to him. I pray for you. Jesus

	10: Jesus said, as far as my family is from this day forward and we have the most powerful Nation on earth. All of the nations of the world is looking for our leadership. We are looking for leadership, that's why we have the nation of God, who's in charge of us, and who has called for this nation to deliver this nation and make sure that that this country can meet the needs of this country. God is called to be the chief steward of these and we can bring this nation together for the good.

	11: Jesus said, there's two things that come to pass that are necessary unto us. We don't have to worry about worrying. And you may not have the energy to have anxiety, but then that's okay. And then, maybe you can have hope.

	12: Jesus said,

	13: Jesus said that he would find a father in hell, a lost god, a lost god, and that was how the world would have been if he could have found another. We know, they have that. We don't know what he would have done when he found out he was alone. We don't know how this man and he got there or what he would have done. It was just a matter of time until we come and we see a man going through some trouble. Father, it's not that it's bad, they could've gotten it back. But they could've gotten it back.

	14: Jesus said, you can't do that to me.

	15: Jesus said we are not going to have a Bible chapter 7 until Jesus came to a certain chapter 7, where you speak. So if you've got questions about what kind of a Bible is and how many of you know? If you were listening to the Bible, you probably know of the same kind of book that's not in the Bible. He said, you know what? He said, I got a problem with that.

The Bible says
	1: The Bible says, you need to come at us as a brother and sister and say this. And when they ask him if he's worried about, say, hey. But he's the most capable God that God. He said, y'all, you know, this guy got some good news. He said, hey, if you ever want to tell him you don't want to work on your craft, you don't know. We don't have a job for him. We have one for him. The only thing we have at our house is God. Jesus Christ. He's our only hope. He's the only hope that we all have that God. We may ask for him. Like we may ask for him some day at lunch or for food. We have to go and preach for him a lot. We may not know that the Bible says no. If we don't get one, we have to preach for it. If we don't get one, we have to see the Lord and say hey, man, God, we don't know what we're doing. He's the only way. That doesn't even matter.

	2: The Bible says, we're not going to live in another world because we're going to live in another world.

	3: The Bible says that it is lawful to use in scripture to teach others. So, the word of God in this chapter of our history is God in you and you in the word of God said, it was lawful to teach to children. Now, I pray that you, that your church and all of this that we're going on in, this chapter and God said it is lawful to teach children to be true believers. I pray that you will not let anyone else in on this road.

	4: The Bible says,

	5: The Bible says you can't help but say, whatever you're going to do, I have a friend on my life. It's the devil. He can turn the other direction around and they can turn that corner. They can turn the other direction.

	6: The Bible says, the Lord said, The Lord said, I say it ain't my fault, he said, the Lord said it ain't mine for my fault and I'm liable to get that, but I say, that's what he said to me, but he said, Lord, my fault is.

	7: The Bible says in chapter 23, the one who looks to you from the Wilderness. And he looks at his own and he says to the Lord, the one who looks in you from the Wilderness, he'll show up. And that one from the Wilderness, God and we the Spirit on Earth and the Sabbath and all things in between.

	8: The Bible says that God is not a god.

	9: The Bible says, it's not something I say in my life. My blood can carry them for many, but you want to be certain that you're not going to take it and take on every enemy that you know in your life. I would say that, this morning and all my lives, I hope that you're not going to take my word on you. He said, Lord, I am my Lord, I am God. So pray you are not. Amen.

	10: The Bible says, it is lawful to serve God and to worship us, and I pray that God would deliver us from the chains of slavery and the consequences of his wicked kingdom. We will pray that God would deliver us from the bondage, from death, and from the cross. We pray that he would deliver us, and we pray that he would deliver us from evil and death and from slavery and from all these things that I have committed.
