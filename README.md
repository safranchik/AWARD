# AWARD
Welcome to the official repo for **AWARD** (_Analysis of Wealth and Religious Distributions_).

To get started, install the requirements using
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then, download the ``.wav`` audio files to ``data/videos`` using the following script:
```python3 audio_extractor.py```

You can edit the list of church videos to download by directly editing the files ```data/links/impoverished_churches.csv``` and ```data/links/wealthy_churches.csv``` before running the script!
